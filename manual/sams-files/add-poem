title: Adding a New Poem to the Current Issue
---

Two flavors of poem are currently supported, and three are under
development.

**Currently**:

-   Lineated poems with any amount of in-line whitespace;
-   Prose poetry

**In Development**:

-   Image-based poems
-   PDF-based poems
-   Poems with very long lines requiring a hanging indent

## Lineated poems

Lineated poems should be formatted in the following manner:

```

---
title: "POEM TITLE HERE"
contributor: "AUTHOR NAME HERE"
issue: 1
---

```                     <!-- Three backticks -->
                        <!-- One linebreak -->
So much depends
upon

a red wheel
barrow

glazed with rain
water

beside the white
chickens
                        <!-- One linebreak -->
```                     <!-- Three backticks -->

```

## Prose poetry

For prose poetry, no backticks are required. Indicate new
paragraphs with a blank line:

```

---
title: "POEM TITLE HERE"
contributor: "AUTHOR NAME HERE"
issue: 2
---

This is a paragraph. Since it is poetry, anything goes, even
though it looks like prose.

This is a new paragraph -- the same "rules" apply here.

```

# Saving Poem Files

New poems must be saved in the directory
`Trilobite/issues/_current/`. They need to be saved as markdown
files (with a `.md` file extension), rather than ordinary
textfiles (`.txt` extension):

![How to Save Poem Files](saving.jpg)

Poems from previous issues should be transferred from the
`_current` folder to `Trilobite/issues/_past/ISSUE` (*e.g.*,
`Trilobite/issues/_past/2/splatter.md` for a poem from issue #2
titled "splatter").
