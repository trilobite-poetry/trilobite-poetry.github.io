title: Adding a New Poem to the Current Issue
---

Three flavors of poem are currently supported, and two are under
development.

**Currently**:

-   Lineated poems with any amount of in-line whitespace;
-   Prose poetry

**In Development**:

-   Image-based poems
-   PDF-based poems
-   Poems with very long lines requiring a hanging indent

## Lineated poems

Lineated poems should be formatted in the following manner:

```

---
title: "POEM TITLE HERE"
contributor: "AUTHOR NAME HERE"
---

```                     <!-- Three backticks -->
                        <!-- One linebreak -->
So much depends
upon

a red wheel
barrow

glazed with rain
water

beside the white
chickens
                        <!-- One linebreak -->
```                     <!-- Three backticks -->

```

## Prose poetry

For prose poetry, no backticks are required. Indicate new
paragraphs with a blank line:

```

---
title: "POEM TITLE HERE"
contributor: "AUTHOR NAME HERE"
---

This is a paragraph. Since it is poetry, anything goes, even
though it looks like prose.

This is a new paragraph -- the same "rules" apply here.

```

# Posting Poems

New poems must be saved in the directory
`Trilobite/issues/_current/`. They need to be saved as markdown
files (with a `.md` file extension), rather than ordinary
textfiles (`.txt` extension):

![How to Save Poem Files](saving.jpg)

After saving all desired files, open **Github Desktop**. This
program allows synchronizes your local files to the site. Github
has an irritating number of checks and balances to prevent
synchronization problems, but the steps are simple:

1. Hit "Fetch Origin." If changes have been made to the site (by
me, for example), the same button will change from "Fetch" to
"Pull." If this happens, hit "Pull" also.

2. Summarize your changes (*e.g.*, "Issue #1"). Optionally, write
a lengthier description of any changes.

3. "Commit to main."

4. Hit "Push Origin" to finalize your changes.

5. Allow time for Jekyll to build the site before confirming that
results are as desired (~4-5min).
