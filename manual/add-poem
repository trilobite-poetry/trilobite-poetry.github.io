title: Adding a New Poem to the Current Issue
---

Three flavors of poem are currently supported, and two are under
development.

**Currently**:

-   Lineated poems with any amount of in-line whitespace;
-   Prose poetry

**In Development**:

-   Image-based poems
-   PDF-based poems
-   Poems with very long lines requiring a hanging indent

## Lineated poems

Lineated poems should be formatted in the following manner:

```

---
title: "POEM TITLE HERE"
contributor: "AUTHOR NAME HERE"
---

```                     <!-- Three backticks -->
                        <!-- One linebreak -->
So much depends
upon

a red wheel
barrow

glazed with rain
water

beside the white
chickens
                        <!-- One linebreak -->
```                     <!-- Three backticks -->

```
