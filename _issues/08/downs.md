## hard like

I met this country girl
{: .ts2 }

from another country
{: .ts2 }

---

she took me
{: .ts4 }

around the world,
{: .ts2 }

it was another world

---

the way she says, y'know
{: .ts2 }

makes me wish I did,
{: .ts4 }

get to sweat that
{: .ts6 }

good stuff out
{: .ts8 }

---

down for the second shot ---
{: .ts2 }

she made it clear
{: .ts6 }

but I don't know how
{: .ts4 }

---

like when somebody

does you a favor

and never tells you

what it was they did.

## brown dirt red

the kid was so street
{: .ts4 }

I had to say hey, kid
{: .ts2 }

whose muddy boots
{: .ts4 }

up under the sheet
{: .ts4 }

every time
{: .ts8 }

---

dirt daubing
{: .ts8 }

a double margin
{: .ts6 }

in bed --- every side
{: .ts6 }

either way
{: .ts10 }

---

we had been led
{: .ts4 }

to understand
{: .ts4 }

---

this was the experience
{: .ts2 }

everyone wanted
{: .ts2 }

---

the kind of zero rewards

that catch you in their prime

---

no wonder when we decided
{: .ts2 }

we had to turn away
{: .ts6 }

## companion of the night wound

some sick stuff in sweet february

we get together to do
{: .ts2 }

to each other
{: .ts4 }

---

like reverse bidding
{: .ts2 }

on your very own
{: .ts2 }

tick tock apocalypse ---

lowest unique bidder

gets to press the button ---

---

the courage of a lost lover

persevering through
{: .ts2 }

the thicket
{: .ts6 }

---

to make eye contact ---
{: .ts2 }

really, any
{: .ts4 }

contact will do ---
{: .ts4 }

## little wages

widely alleged
{: .ts4 }

to be a thing
{: .ts4 }

---

some yahoo mini john

with a dumb luck job
{: .ts4 }

and a one-room love
{: .ts2 }

---

quitting comes easy
{: .ts2 }

to a quitter like me ---
{: .ts2 }

---

it's the living
{: .ts4 }

in it after
{: .ts4 }

you have to do
{: .ts4 }

that hurts ---
{: .ts6 }

---

it never seemed like

leaving town
{: .ts4 }

was the way to get
{: .ts2 }

ahead but here I go ---

## wrecking flowers

trick or treat dancefloor

these are the kids
{: .ts2 }

you expected
{: .ts4 }

---

one up 
{: .ts2 }

two up
{: .ts8 .nolinebreak }

blow up 
{: .ts2 }

screw up
{: .ts8 .nolinebreak }

---

space clodhopper
{: .ts2 }

in the nite glo
{: .ts4 }

---

my non-word compliance

with the dictates
{: .ts4 }

of little cherry jane
{: .ts2 }

---

and I was kind of like
{: .ts2 }

oh huh who wow ---
{: .ts4 }

## poem

I live with a condition

called being hungry ---
{: .ts2 }

science has yet
{: .ts4 }

to develop a remedy ---

---

even our dreams'
{: .ts4 }

very fulfillment
{: .ts2 }

does not always
{: .ts4 }

have the desired effect ---

---

it will take
{: .ts6 }

a second lifetime
{: .ts2 }

to get my fill
{: .ts4 }

## tiepolo mississippi for bill

about as big
{: .ts4 }

a geographic
{: .ts2 }

as a man could pull --- I got

meaning on my mind,
{: .ts4 }

to do so early
{: .ts8 }

in the morning fog ---
{: .ts4 }

---

pigment
{: .ts4 }

& pigpen
{: .ts2 }

---

my minimalist

roots have
{: .ts4 }

grown over
{: .ts2 }

## some things

--- after Sam Biddle
{: .forenote}

taking a crack
{: .ts2 }

at the pi√±ata

isn't always
{: .ts2 }

about the candy

---

some things you can't
{: .ts2 }

stay home and binge,
{: .ts2 }

---

some things you must
{: .ts2 }

come out to see ---
{: .ts2 }

---

they would not want
{: .ts2 }

you to miss it ---
{: .ts2 }

## hit the snowbuckle

everybody kind
{: .ts2 }

of looked like
{: .ts4 }

they had wandered in

from the rain
{: .ts4 }

---

folsom roses
{: .ts4 }

---

strawberry blues
{: .ts2 }

---

weather like the weekly chore

of some unworshipped god,
{: .ts2 }

points for showing up
{: .ts4 }

---

the adjustment was on
{: .ts2 }

we were there for it,
{: .ts4 }

welcoming ---
{: .ts6 }

---

we will never be
{: .ts4 }

completely ready
{: .ts2 }
