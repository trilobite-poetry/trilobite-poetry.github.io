## self-scrying

tepid water prevents exit

and pleasure, tonight on the phone
{: .ts2 }

the neighbor laughs through the wall
{: .ts6 }

*I'm in the tub* a rare mirroring
{: .ts6 }

of our bodies
{: .ts6 }

in this structure made for efficiency

I kink my neck
{: .ts2 }

like a live wire
{: .ts6 }

there's a breeze on my knees

in repose
{: .ts6 }

I attempt the host, a conduit searching

for a signal to issue from
{: .ts2 }

crumbling grout and sallow

form, my place to plug into
{: .ts2 }

as visions weren't

my purview, I do
{: .ts6 }

in the tub what Joseph did in his hat
{: .ts2 }

it takes great effort

to translate the body
{: .ts4 }

into something less authoritative
{: .ts2 }

something less secret, I attempt

enthusiasm, divine
{: .ts10 }

possession, unadorned
{: .ts6 }

you will not laugh when I have removed so much

to be understood
{: .ts2 }

---

*--- the boys' tussle with the pigskin*
{: .ts3 }

*marks the ritual, in the late fall dusk*
{: .ts3 }

*their breath made visible, the girls*
{: .ts3 }

*preparing the site*
{: .ts3 }

---

I sample so many substances

over the course of so many hours
{: .ts2 }

one sensation bleeding into another

hard to tell beginning from end
{: .ts2 }

in this Pythian potluck, we speak intelligibly

of the furnace buckling
{: .ts2 }

from the cold,
{: .ts12 }

of the structure void of care
{: .ts3 }

slumlord
{: .ts15 }

what seems only heard until it is said

it sounds like the flaming aura of volition
{: .ts2 }

the seraphim kept warm in circulation

of our own holy rage it seems
{: .ts2 }

it's how I know I'm alive --

---

a soviet blanket I buy online

under the covers, our knees, soft protrusions
{: .ts2 }

*afflict the comfortable, COMFORT the AFFLICTED*

I make it my background, a talisman
{: .ts2 }

until it disappears

the curves
{: .ts8 }

I dress to disguise, keep moving

get going or lost -- and what
{: .ts2 }

would happen if I became

the eye of the goddamn beholder
{: .ts2 }

would I defend it or pluck out mine own

it doesn't even hurt
{: .ts2 }

the self-enucleating martyrs claimed

with such fervor, who is the prayer for?
{: .ts2 }

annually anointed with the oily sheen

of back-to-school specials
{: .ts2 }

and blessings
{: .ts12 }

if this is just one of many
{: .ts7 }

possible worlds
{: .ts3 }

I don't want another object
{: .ts10 }

lesson, if I gave you what I believe
{: .ts3 }

your attention is worth
{: .ts4 }

I'd have to put it on layaway
{: .ts3 }

every day we give our lives getting
{: .ts4 }

into the lowest kingdom
{: .ts3 }

## self-scrying

from the edge of the counter a melody, my phone

fills the silence in the lyrics I mishear
{: .ts2 }

someone's mother say *enjoy your mind*

as our mothers couldn't, their thoughts cleaving
{: .ts2 }

themselves where the seams won't match-up

-- do you understand I am just the sound
{: .ts2 }

of that tear flapping in the wind

its ragged pulp in the elements
{: .ts2 }

with sunflowers for witness?
{: .ts4 }

I learn the syntax we're couched in.
{: .ts2 }

lisping, our names sound wrong when repeated
{: .ts4 }

but there was no error in our tongues
{: .ts2 }

rooting in the gaps for the sibyl in sibilant
{: .ts4 }

the syllables in voluble
{: .ts13 }


## self-scrying

every day I take myself out

for a walk, my body, my pet
{: .ts2 }

a gossamer new leaf

light strains through
{: .ts2 }

between green matter and shadow

under the catalpa, her exclamation
{: .ts2 }

sets my eyes to their blossoms: open

gently flaring trumpets *they are*
{: .ts2 }

*perfect* the seed catalogue insists

---

snowy clusters midsummer before

or after the protest we spill out
{: .ts2 }

they take their time blooming

and growing effete, I read
{: .ts2 }

before opening enough
{: .ts9 }

to invite the wandering bee

in -- white ruffles
{: .ts9 }

yellow painted ridges

a purple spray along the throat
{: .ts6 }

I am made to understand

they have made themselves
{: .ts2 }

desirable

---

who wrote this? how often
{: .ts5 }

do they get paid? can they
{: .ts2 }

take a bath? do they know

how to please their lovers?

have their arches fallen? I come
{: .ts2 }

more easily when I ask you to

meet me on the page through screen-
{: .ts2 }

shots and photos, our hearts annotate the margins

within an indexicality that can't translate encounter
{: .ts2 }

we try anyway --
{: .ts2 }

now you pipe *catalpa!* now I am pointing
{: .ts10 }

off the page, our shadows bob and tilt in unison
{: .ts10 }

## self-scrying

today fewer words, but repeated with intention

I try to create a loop of recognition
{: .ts2 }

between me and this dog I call mine

all lungs and fur, my thoughts
{: .ts2 }

wander, her harness growing tighter

we walk at an irregular hour
{: .ts2 }

me a little stoned, her a little smaller

than when I first found her confused
{: .ts2 }

and affable so greeting everyone

we meet strategically
{: .ts8 }

searching only sometimes

reaching the thawing
{: .ts2 }

goose scat -- not quite
{: .ts6 }

a steady pace lagging or four steps ahead

of me, she knows my body
{: .ts2 }

now hesitates when I stop

girl, I tune out too---
{: .ts6 }

when the frequency's not right
{: .ts2 }

most of the time just fuzz

the ghost of a sound
{: .ts2 }

through the grave of another

lesser-listened station, searching
{: .ts2 }

for the center of a crystal receiver

an algorithm designed for the dimensions of

your heartbreak, love songs
{: .ts2 }

ache most that don't reflect
{: .ts5 }

our expression.
{: .ts13 }

I turn the dial in my car but can't find a song

that satisfies, can't find my station, never sure
{: .ts2 }

if I was hearing the holy ghost or

my own beating heart pulling me away
{: .ts2 }

toward vitality

I didn't climb the tree to fall and yet I did
{: .ts2 }

the astrologer says I want to be a bad child

but I was better taught to be a good mother
{: .ts2 }

---

she holds her nose high in the wind
{: .ts2 }

my Aeolean harp, how you terrify

me with your need and balking deference
{: .ts2 }

we're a similar breed, going all in

for the chase, can you keep up --
{: .ts2 }

she keeps running

long after the others stop
{: .ts4 }

trailing her, eyes open wide enough

to let out a small demon
{: .ts2 }

here in the ninth month of relative isolation

I was beginning to hear the shape
{: .ts2 }

of the neighbors' home through mine

not the sea but your own blood
{: .ts2 }

rushing through its veins -- *you are living*

*it's true*, they use their kitchen doorway
{: .ts2 }

to extend their game too

## self-scrying

one of my lovers calls me before I call him

sick with the virus, he tells me
{: .ts2 }

of dreams so vivid I forget mine

white, cataclysmic Western dramas
{: .ts2 }

originating in the evangelical foothills

on the other side of the mountain
{: .ts2 }

from the shadow it cast on me

I can't listen for what I can't separate
{: .ts2 }

from myself, groomed as he once was

a woman, to speak in tongues, I strain
{: .ts2 }

to hear the expectation buried deep

in clay soil before we were born
{: .ts2 }

somehow it took -- and ever since

I've been running on empty
{: .ts2 }

dreams of rural ecstasy
{: .ts7 }

sweat curls, ours or the animals'
{: .ts2 }

another sacred grove to receive a vision

new bites to scratch, another congregation
{: .ts2 }

to sacrifice yourself to, there being so many ways

to worship, every day we wake
{: .ts2 }

to do it all over again -- I leave

to walk my dog, threading the leash

around my fist, I had never known love
{: .ts2 }

this shape, the pull and release, her face

now beginning to turn toward mine
{: .ts2 }

when the tension's too great, what's better

in a pack, what's better in a sleeve
{: .ts2 }

my arm in shorthand heralding a new pedigree.
