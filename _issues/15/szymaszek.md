## ESSAY 11

I would not
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

have guessed
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

that Wren
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

and I would become friends
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

I thought her attentions were strictly
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

apple-motivated but she comes to me even
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

when I am not presenting an apple
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

which to her probably looks like
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

a brown orb as cows perceive reds
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

and greens in tones of brown
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

she puts her head down
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

and lets me scratch behind her ears
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

between her eyes and the small of her horns
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

I learned that each birth leaves
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

one ring on their horns
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

when they are allowed to keep
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

their horns Wren has at least
{: .ts24 .doublespace }

five rings on her very tall horns which will
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

continue to grow as long as she lives
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

they are warm and full of air space that connect to her
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

sinuses yesterday she took the apple but let it fall out of her
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

mouth twice then followed me into the sun and closed
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

her eyes I could hear her breathing so
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

started breathing with her as I had been
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

tense all day she started lightly snoring
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

still adjusting her ears to the sound of the
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

piglets screeching over old bread
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

the calf Wren is carrying was sired by a bull
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

named Hansel his sires have been
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

stillborn or coming out with "bad placements"
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

giving the cows difficult births so
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

I worry for Wren who is due in January.
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

## ESSAY 12

I heard that it takes up to thirty minutes to get into deep
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

concentration which could explain why I write in my head
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

while I'm driving to and from work and then wait and see what my
meno-
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

pause mind can recall capitalism
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

is a real war monger loving war and
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

the language of war (its metaphors) so I must battle
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

we must fight for everything
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

and have mighty will I have practiced
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

death for so long all that remains for my body
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

to do is physically die all that remains
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

for the organization to do is to die.
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

I realized that if I had a money job in the arts
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

right now I would lose it I feel lucky to have
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

made a life in a barn of cows working out the tendencies
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

of the mind to cling and of the heart to close to suffering
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

so many past puzzles have worked themselves out
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

now that the power cat is out of the power bag
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

I only get closer to this shaggy calve who has found
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

her mother's friend last week she had snot in her nose
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

which after we rubbed heads ended up in my hair
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

which already stands on end
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

my colleague kindly cleaned it up with a corner
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

of my lunch bag I didn't care I could've been covered
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

in her snot and been pleased I want to say
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

something like we experienced solidarity
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

but I don't know if that is what it is
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

in the animal economy in all the brutal economies
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

that will kill me in slyer ways most of our affections
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

occur as policy allows my lunch break their groupings and rotating
pastures
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

an ever-shifting ship list I wonder if a little
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

heifer conditioned to associate her farm humans
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

with dopamine rushes feels good when she makes a
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

farm human laugh? As my human solidarities
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

grow more sharply ideological and
{: .ts24 .doublespace }

laughter wears thin I wonder this.
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

At the holiday staff party
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

in line for food I chatted with a farmer who
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

broke his eye contact with me when I started talking
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

about Donut I said uh oh he said he didn't have a lot
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

of hope for her she's plucky what does that
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

mean? not hearty he said a crumb of cracker
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

went down the wrong pipe as I tried to sort out
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

that plucky was a bad quality and meant in farmer language
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

not hearty the more I tried
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

to be impassive the more I choked
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

on the cracker I drove home in the rain
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

and that night when I closed my eyes
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

I was again visited by white blobs that turned into cow
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

shapes grazing on blob grass but this time more detail came
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

into focus I could see little hairs around the ears I could
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

be ill or these hallucinations could be the random firing of cells
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

time
will tell the reason I become friends with
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

any cow is because they are interested
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

in me there are cows that are more wild who
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

want nothing to do with me I started to get the sense that
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

my connection with certain cows was fated and divine
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

I had a quick fantasy that I was rich and could protect
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

them by giving the farm a huge amount of money
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

to care for my special group a nightmare philanthropist
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

but if I am honest the heart of the matter is to be able to
keep
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

loving in the face of cow-sorrow unspeakable brevity
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

unpredictability and contradictions
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

to bravely do it against such powerful forces as this
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

is thus also plucky.
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

## ESSAY 13

I drove through valleys of fog day after day
{: .ts3 .doublespace }

in the El Ni√±o winter Catskill Creek overspilled its western bank
{: .doublespace }

by over 200 feet swept away an elderly woman in her car
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

who drove around the road flooded sign
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

people are surprised by how easily water can overpower us
{: .ts3 .doublespace }

this is what my dad said followed by advice the trick
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

is to roll down your window before submersion
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

otherwise you'll never get the door open
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

we talk about the weather he's having
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

in the Midwest which comes eastward to my town
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

along the latitude line we share over the past weeks
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

I've heard songs that have Midwestern cities and states in their
titles
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

John Hyatt's "All the Lilacs in Ohio" Dar Williams's "Iowa (Traveling
III)"
{: .ts3 .doublespace }

and Lucinda Williams's "Minneapolis" I haven't heard
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

any Wisconsin songs where I'm from but many people
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

on the East coast think Milwaukee is Minneapolis
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

when my parents were house hunting
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

in the 70s they took us to see
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

a farm house but didn't end up buying it instead
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

we lived in the suburbs where I shed my animal
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

dreams. Today my partner
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

and I rewatched Miyazaki's *Kiki's Delivery Service*
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

paused on the heart to heart Kiki has with
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

her friend Ursula who says "The spirit of witches
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

the spirit of artists the spirit of bakers
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

I suppose it must be a power given by God
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

Sometimes you suffer for
it."
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

I've never thought of suffering in the gift
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

economy suffering in exchange for the power
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

and protection of poetry but in the most shit storm repellent
suit
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

it still gets in your face. While Kiki looks
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

for a town to live in she falls asleep on a train
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

full of hay is awakened by cows licking her
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

feet apologizes to them for sleeping
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

on their breakfast Miyazaki cows are friends
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

I'm so attuned to their shapes I spied a cow cookie
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

jar in the background shot of a sitcom a distant cow
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

laying behind a tree in Pennsylvania and
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

the Holstein that is a cat that sometimes graces
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

our backyard. I am able to see
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

now how Donut isn't as hearty as her peers
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

on Thursday I thought she was dashing toward me till
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

I saw that one of her nurse cows had risen and she was after
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

some milk had to scurry with another calve as the cow
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

was not in the mood I tried to assist by scratching the cow's
head
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

I think her name is Layla she stayed still for a minute
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

allowing the calves to drink I remembered
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

after Donna gave birth to her she immediately went for
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

the colostrum she needed but Donna was Donna.
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

Money talks and what it blabs is that life is not precious
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

not even for an animated girl witch who loses her ability to
fly
{: .ts3 .doublespace }

and communicate with her cat because her delivery job burned her
out
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

I tell myself in the face of fear that my life is not
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

precious I tell myself this doing my stretches
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

if all disease is eternally present
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

into the loafing shed I go
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

irredeemable inflamed but with my gift of leadership
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

that points to
one rogue end via a million
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

collaborative routes my life is not precious not more
precious
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

than the the life of a cow or any low down being so much can
happen
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

in thirty-shed-minutes the elongation of a moment
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

into a collapse of time rejoicing the prehistory of wild
aurochs
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

an ethic of all life as continuous and convivial the perfect
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

banality with which I returned to my office.
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

## ESSAY 14

The poet Sachio It≈ç was a dairy farmer
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

wrote lines about brushing the cows daily and how
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

his clothes must stink it is such a smell it is
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

such a beautiful smell that there is no one word for
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

so I will say it is the smell of time
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

the hot fermented core of living matter
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

the inner hay that can look like
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

seaweed that is the basis of my winter routine
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

meeting Wren in the back part of the dry cow paddock
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

to feed her this prized hay she is never willing
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

to share using her huge horns to clear space
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

around her so the others can only watch as she
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

gets the best bits Cairo being among the others I've worked
out
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

a way to feed them both by giving Wren a mouthful and then
rushing
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

to the other side to feed Cairo today Wren took an apple
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

and let me scratch her head but she likes it best when
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

we are close but not touching I learned that she is
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

part Brangus Brahman mixed with Angus and
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

something else I forgot the closer I feel
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

to some cows the harder it gets to narrate is best
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

conveyed by the harmony running through my playlist
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

or low excitement that we call a habit or somehow coalescing
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

in thin air innocence and horror of being. We sang to the
cows
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

during Saturnalia "the cattle are lowing the baby awakes..."
the
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

belief holds that on Christmas Eve animals gain
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

the "gift of speech" at midnight but what
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

if humans gained the gift of going on olfactory cues
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

reading degrees of muscle tension
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

nonverbal auditory sounds such as lowing and waking
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

It≈ç wrote "when
cowherds begin to make poems
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

&nbsp;&nbsp;many new styles
{: .ts13 .doublespace }

&nbsp;&nbsp;in the world
{: .ts13 .doublespace }

&nbsp;&nbsp;will spring up"
{: .ts13 .doublespace }

when cow herders begin to make poems
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

we will gain the gift of mooing
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

the oldest surviving English poem was written by a herder
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

in the 600s named C√¶dmon who was said to have been illiterate
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

but after a dream visitation was able to to sing words
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

that he had never heard of before the oldest known poem is
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

of course Gilgamesh whose mother's name Ninsun
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

means "wild cow" she helped her son interpret
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

his dreams. In *The Story of Ferdinand* the bull grew up
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

to become entirely himself the real life gentle Civil√≥n
"Large
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

Civilian" a colloquial slur Spanish soldiers used
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

for ordinary citizens was granted a rare pardon after a bullfight
but
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

before he could make it back to his pasture and the farmer's
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

daughter who loved him Franco's
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

militiamen butchered him and ate him before
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

the resistance could drive them away.
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

In December a young Longhorn steer
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

they say escaped a slaughterhouse in Newark ended
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

up on NJT tracks causing long delays he was rescued
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

by a sanctuary and is recovering from an infection they named
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

him Ricardo after a helpful police officer I just watched a video
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

of
him eating apples with his IV and balls of tape
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

on the tips of his horns he is sweet and calm with
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

a chestnut coat as
always with feel good local
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

news one can always sense the hand of management. The bull
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

at the farm I work at is named Luke his mating
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

bellow interrupts our meetings and keeps
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

the apprentices living next to the shed up at night
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

during lunch last week my colleague
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

and I witnessed Luke mate with
{: .ts24 .doublespace }

a cow an apprentice came up and asked
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

"was he successful" if it takes 4 seconds I think so
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

the pair gently clacked their horns
{: .ts21 .doublespace }

he continued to follow her
inhaling
{: .ts24 .doublespace }

her estrus his lips curled and nostrils
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

partly closed I learned this is called the Flehmen
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

response in the chaos of mating I still kept up the effort to
comb
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

Donut whose long winter coat has been patchy due to a winter's
lack
{: .ts9 .doublespace }

of vitamin D the hierarchy kicked into high formal
{: .ts12 .doublespace }

the rhythmic body sweep of the feeding
{: .ts15 .doublespace }

stalls such that Donut and I had to refind
{: .ts18 .doublespace }

each other every few minutes.
{: .ts15 .doublespace }
