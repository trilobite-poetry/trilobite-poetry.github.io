## BATH SALTS

no half of   
me is enough   
to save me   

---

from your charity,   
and because the   
text was destroyed   

---

while the page   
was saved, no   
whole of me   

---

can be treated   
as my mind.   
so when i'm   

---

lying here sleepless   
and suffering, in   
communion with the   

---

anti-future as   
rising memory where   
a ghost borrows   

---

flickers from feeling   
once lived to   
transmute disappearance into   

---

doubt, to line   
and stun the   
breeze-endings which   

---

carry to us   
ourselves as moods,   
i rub my   

---

eyes and think   
how while my   
eyes get so   

---

old and nasty   
my ignorance remains   
pristine, proof that   

---

my ignorance is   
specially saved, is   
making me write   

---

this again. this   
night i repeat   
is a siege   

---

against every shining   
resource of the   
day, turns me   

---

inoperative, keeps me   
poor, inventing elsewhere   
as no-page   

---

under the protection   
of disaster. i   
listen out for   

---

the tiny cries   
until listening dries   
them out and   

---

we're bathing here   
in our dried-   
out night canyon   

---

under the theory   
sky of no   
possible change.   

---

## PASSING ARM

i ran away   
from my face   
because what's larger   

---

the way i   
sharpen and extend   
this sadness or   

---

all the tasks   
i'm failing to   
do? mirror voice   

---

abandoned and loose,   
whispering shards, repping   
in cuts its   

---

warped scale, you   
virtuoso doctor against   
thought, you trendy   

---

false planet, your   
breath dissolves the   
flower as you   

---

pick it, and   
your numb conversation   
with an anagram   

---

of end-times   
protects only our   
junk-strewn witness   

---

cramps, and farms   
our impulses in   
no profile hunger   

---

mines to baby   
your bad meanings.   
thanks. what? i   

---

said thanks. i   
sift the flour   
which piles up   

---

in a pile   
in the bowl.   
i was lying   

---

down and sleeping   
off the hex.   
i was lying   

---

in bed and   
playing phlegm, dislodging   
and reabsorbing my   

---

material as a   
system of signs.   
these days i   

---

play to make   
living unreal and   
for that i'm   

---

misaligned and turned   
around and genuinely   
sorry. i left   

---

the keys in   
the front door   
all night and   

---

for that i'm   
also sorry. please   
let me not   

---

run from the   
width we don't   
see which whispers   

---

en masse and   
drinks our faces.   
let my avatar   

---

be removed from   
our graph of   
live wind data   

---

which shows my   
senses as broken,   
my strange practices   

---

useless, a meal   
of magic gone   
straight through us,   

---

uncatalyzed as prayer.   
to get saved   
drag a fallen   

---

steel playground net   
across an abandoned   
harp trap.
