## Pineapple Man

I cut the soft supple flesh of the pineapple with
{: .doublespace }

the sharpened steel blade of my knife.
{: .ts3 .doublespace }

This is not a
{: .doublespace }

murder.
{: .ts3 .doublespace }

This is not a
{: .doublespace }

crime,
{: .ts3 .doublespace }

Because we do not live in a world where pineapples are sentient, or
{: .doublespace }

Are considered beings,
{: .doublespace }

Or given even the most cursory of rights.
{: .doublespace }

But there is a world---because, according to the quantum theory
{: .doublespace }

Of multiple worlds, there has to
{: .doublespace }

be---
{: .ts3 .doublespace }

Where pineapples are not only sentient but
{: .doublespace }

Are in charge, are the dominant species,
{: .doublespace }

---

---

And in this land I
{: .doublespace }

Am a ruthless killer,
{: .doublespace }

A creature to be feared for my
{: .doublespace }

Savage ways, the utter
{: .doublespace }

Glee with which I slay my victims.
{: .doublespace }

---

---

In this world, pineapple society
{: .doublespace }

Wants nothing more than to catch
{: .doublespace }

Me, to imprison me, to put me in
{: .doublespace }

The electric chair or whatever the pineapple
{: .doublespace }

Equivalent of that grisly punishment might be,
{: .doublespace }

To give the families of my victims
{: .doublespace }

Some shred of resolution or retribution, however
{: .doublespace }

Slight. And as they gather to watch
{: .doublespace }

As I am put to death for my many,
{: .doublespace }

Many pineapple murders,
{: .doublespace }

They will hear my final words, bemoaning
{: .doublespace }

The fact that I live in a world where
{: .doublespace }

My simple desire to consume the sweet
{: .doublespace }

Flesh of ripe fruit
{: .doublespace }

Makes me a monster.
{: .doublespace }

---

---

Artie my son cries from the next
{: .doublespace }

Room. He is not
{: .doublespace }

A pineapple,
{: .doublespace }

But he is a newborn and is roughly the same
{: .doublespace }

Size and, when swaddled,
{: .doublespace }

Shape.
{: .doublespace }

## Fear of Shitting

I lived in New York

City for ten years and
{: .ts2 }

every damn day of my life I

Was afraid that I'd pissed
{: .ts2 }

And shat my pants on

the subway, that it was just
{: .ts2 }

A matter of time until

someone took a whiff and
{: .ts2 }

The whole car would turn to me

In judgment and disgust at what
{: .ts2 }

I'd done

---

Sure, my paranoia of

accidentally shitting was just
{: .ts2 }

that: paranoia, a fantasy, a product

of OCD and anxiety; but I've
{: .ts2 }

seen similar things happen in

reality. For example
{: .ts2 }

---

I remember being on the

subway late one night
{: .ts2 }

when my nostrils were

suddenly flooded with the
{: .ts2 }

smell of fresh shit

fresh human shit
{: .ts2 }

I looked up and met the eyes of

the man across from me
{: .ts2 }

who said very loudly not just

to me but to everyone
{: .ts2 }

"what the fuck?". Then the

train stopped at a station
{: .ts2 }

and half the car moved

to another car
{: .ts2 }

away from the overpowering smell

of human shit.
{: .ts2 }

---

I cherish these moments of connection

between strangers, that
{: .ts2 }

intersection of shit smell connecting sphincter

to my nasal passages and
{: .ts2 }

then my eyes connected to another man's eyes

whose own nostrils are connected
{: .ts2 }

to the other man's sphincter and then everyone

lurching from the car in mad
{: .ts2 }

succession all of us tied by an invisible

tether the nexus of which is one man's
{: .ts2 }

unclenched sphincter

this is the New York that I love
{: .ts2 }

this is democracy in action.

---

Now I live in Los Angeles

which isn't nearly as democratic
{: .ts2 }

if I don't want to smell human shit

I can put the windows up
{: .ts2 }

and if I'm afraid I'm going to shit

I can just pull over anywhere
{: .ts2 }

or shit in the car

## birds i've known

i awoke from strange dreams

and saw a crow outside my window

bobbing on a fucking branch
{: .ts2 }

aaron, the crow said, you

are a worm
{: .ts2 }

you have

a little worm dick

and a little worm soul and a little

worm existence

---

then it flew off with what i can only imagine was self-satisfaction.

---

and i'd never even met this asshole bird before!

---

how did he know so much about me?

## everywhere

I look

Birds
{: .ts9 }

Everywhere

I turn my ear

Birds
{: .ts9 }

The squawk

The squeak

The hideous

chirp of

Birds
{: .ts9 }

In the trees

Birds
{: .ts9 }

In the streets

Birds
{: .ts9 }

On the power

Lines and telephone

Poles and the street

Signs and the gutter

of the neighboring house

Birds
{: .ts9 }

They won't let me sleep

They won't let me think

They won't let me relax

Birds
{: .ts9 }

I wake up in the morning

And before I can have even

A cup of coffee I hear them

Chirping like hell cherubs

Birds
{: .ts9 }

Like Satan's angels themselves

In big disgusting flocks

Telling me things like

"You've been bad and you'll
{: .ts2 }

be worse, nothing you've
{: .ts2 }

done shall ever be forgiven"
{: .ts2 }

---

---

Oh these

Birds
{: .ts9 }

What do you do about

Birds
{: .ts9 }

I truly hate these

Birds
{: .ts9 }
