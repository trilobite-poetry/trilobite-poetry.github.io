## Call from a strange number

Call from a strange number about resolving   
the new pain in my mouth that I've told exactly zero   
people about   
I said I'd return their call within   
the six month referral period   
I said I'm tired of errands   
yet they keep walking up and leashing me   
in chemically   
warm spring sun I sit and let shadows   
tire my skin   

---

Feeling the softest sting on the back of   
my hand and wrist and forearm   
Wishing I could unhear so much because   
seemingly every person is clashing   
or asking for some fulfilled thing that   
I said I'd return complete before running off   
to a new divot to squat in to softly box   
the ground til more change or requests   

## pressure

How can I bring myself   
Running rabid and apathetic   
We've just got to deal   
It's a weekly rotation   
You can see an individual's tension rise   

---

Most can't hold back   
Running rabid and apathetic   
It's nearly my turn   
Everything's under my skin   
just Go with it   

---

Do you get how we could be this way?

## Monday, September

Isn't a swarm of any   
Nonhuman crowd some   
Sort of overwhelming?   

---

You might can      
Acclimate and stifle      
But the anxious      

---

Spark will   
Still repeatedly   
Be Born.   

---

I'm worn and not   
Because it's Monday.   
The choir of birds out back   

---

Raucously squeak out the end of   
Summer, they don't   
Want to hear the world's   

---

Crunchiness that comes   
After all the lines've   
Melted together for so   

---

Many weeks. Inside,   
The grapefruit juice   
Is a color that's aged   

---

Like this conversation,   
Pervasive and I don't   
Want to hear it but   

---

Must be gone through,   
Rot's not an option.   
Acclimate and stifle   

---

Whatever you don't   
Think is productive,   
(a wild thought considering   

---

The need for an economy   
Of the dance against the   
Raucously opposing rants   

---

That can't let any other   
Thing be as it could).   
What is offered up   

---

As a good faith discussion   
Feels bait for another   
Set of overwhelming   

---

Control devices that   
I can't accept, will be   
Repeatedly worn by,   
and want to forever end   

## a few types

flattened yourselves into   
protagonist's poses in need of attn   
Eyes rolled and the days rolled on   
Nothing changed for the better.   
some faceless judgement:   

---

Bro is a little too grandiose   
for his own good. It's   
endearing but one is inevitably   
tucked away. Out in the   
field I ache for the sake of scraps.   
and you? [shrugs, waves you off]   

---

Bro is a little too aggressively   
anti- his former milieu   
Showing his ass, it's small   
like a Dennis Cooper character's   
Dialed in   
like a Dennis Cooper listicle   
yet frothing   

---

Bro is Unable to   
be normal in the room   
has to itemize and/or squint   
with scrutiny. Goes home   
and wonders about himself   
smokes a bowl and hates himself,   
another casualty   

---

I'm out in friendless rooms making   
my way and enjoying the ambiance   
No stuttering, unable to be normal but that's   
because there is no standard   
where consistency's a question   
of starvation or not   
of playing into it or not   

---

I'm watching decent guys   
fall victim to their hangups.   
they'll go hungry   

---

Eyes roll at the ensuing desperation,   
wallets open or walk away,   
delusion widens or grows plausible   

## You couldn't pay me to care

You couldn't pay me to care. Well, maybe   
But the desperation is plasticized into something you   
may or may not can glean. Can't read me. God tells me to   
reel it in or starve. Old friends askancedly sympathetic   
and confused. Yes I'll take your donations. Yes I'll take   
whatever facebook gives us for free from the neighborhoods   
we lie about living in. Am I still allowed a meal   
if I didn't meet your virtue quota? I bite every hand   
I'm obese and hungry and my daughters will one   
day be embarrassed by all the noise. The doctor made a comment   
about money and I shot him a look. Everyone does me a disservice   
because they aren't feeding the delusion. Fixing things   
can be so simple, it's just always gift-wrapped into   
inaccessibility. An issue that has dragged for years   
solved in minutes when you're in the right room   
But getting there? Best pray and play into heartstrings   
I clearly begrudge and am invariably jokerfied by this   

## Hourly Parking

Dont be tricked down into a mudpit   
by your friend   
Keep all affairs settled alone, away from love   
Your heavenly parking   
is Only a quick fix to whatever's   
subconsciously jumping out of ya   

---

a Sweet bowing of notes of   
swollen and adorable eyes set to   
convince you into a mudpit of debt   
of dragged into Some Whole Thing   
that shouldnt be happening   

---

Heavenly parking's only a quick fix,   
they clock your hours in the zone   
out in this neighborhood. The   
whole thing's tentative, you'll move on   
into new degradable/ing scenesz.   

## neglected

ppl get so obsessed   
with experiments that   
they can't engage normally   
with normal things   

---

They should go dust the high surfaces   
of their nests and scrubb down tubs   
My pants are wet as I say go   

---

live out the pleasures in slowness.   
a Sitcom Life is one disturbed   
and only reaching out   
back to slowness   
or the other way around   

---

an obstacle   
can only be neglected   
into abstraction for so long.   
There's inevitable drama   
You couldve just handled it   
Now sorry and sad   
You were busy seeing   
what happened   
Normal turned dire   
Piss puddled at ankles   

---

It was an unconscious experiment   
at neglect, and   
all that you involve   
into motion will be back to see   
how it negatively affects you   

## Are you sure

Are you sure

We share some ideas and then it grows still and awkward

I don't see it that way

It's hard to explain the way wryness steers us apart off into singular

judgements rude or anxious or smiling
{: .ts3 }

I'm smiling and rude or it feels like it with these reactions I get

So okay, whatever. Are you sure?

---

This is a long walk down to what hopefully turns out to be a long walk down

into unhappily forthright feelings or smiling near-silences in the melting ice
