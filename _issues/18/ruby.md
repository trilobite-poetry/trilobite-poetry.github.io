## We Each Have Our Own Words

I
{: .ts8 }

---

We toil in the vineyard of Adam and Eve

---

Each solves this refined tablet

---

Have an outside chance of timing the silver button a seminary

---

Our ease involves a program of regrets

---

Own face in the mountains, held to a standard

---

Words...

---

II
{: .ts8 }

---

We sentinel pines, incurable bastards, the whole malarkey

---

Each after these crumbums brang within inches

---

Have petunias, will travel

Have all the standards in the Simon, brice or regulated, caramelized

---

Our neck stops lures

Our Sunnydale swelters in an egg

---

Own pilot to pomp or throne in the incited Pericles

---

Words base their freedom

---

III
{: .ts8 }

---

We elevate our sessions to landlocked basket

---

Each proud and unfree, ready to break, shatter into a million pieces, a
million one-dollar bills

---

Have omnivores in backup

Have an elevated member of the Simon Sykes

---

Our precise bird

our registration in the commission

endless deeds, spilled rigor

sizable allowance for unpleasant surprises

---

Own strikes against the very personable

---

Words ring

Words follow

Words impend

---

IV
{: .ts8 }

---

We enter the moment

of revival

---

Each person

silvers

this

Rorschach

---

Each person

silvers

this

contribution

to society

---

We each

Have

Our own words

We each

Have

Have

---

Have no illusions

about their polyanna

---

Have a lustrous foil

---

Have the pig boat in thine eye

---

Our sundial

on top of a table

---

We each have

Our

Own words

Our own

Own

---

Own soul

to break

the dicey

---

Own poise

to hold

---

Own interior

inside

the long

corridors

---

Own signs

to follow

---

Own house

to bathe

---

Own books

---

We each

Have our own

Words

Each

Have our own

Words

---

Words add to themselves

Words subtract from themselves

---

V
{: .ts8 }

---

We two

Each race

Have fault

Our toy

Own boys room

Words outgrow

---

We pray

Each soil

Have dogs

Our lock

Own honeymoon

Words stop

---

We dry

Each holiday

Have ten

Our poy

Own leaven

Words perp

---

We dreg

Each salmon

Have saws

Our belt

Own owl

Words sleep

---

VI
{: .ts8 }

---

We saw the rising parkinglot inside our gigantic mind

---

Each voice laved the sleeper and tongues of fire heated the basal

---

Have inside the perfect rind for our sockdolager triangulation

---

Our forethought

our foreknowledge of the past

the past the one reality

---

Own marbles on the block

sandbags somewhere

and a polished cistern

---

Words aggregators

---

Words come to the rescue

but don't always succeed

## Life Is Like That

For Memphis Slim
{: .forenote }

You've plated the rating and cry cry cry

Well and sometimes the soda runs out of places to go, places to be

Lie the Rogers to its conclusion, its absolute conclusion

Well the poison ya gotta do at the Poisson Rouge

Well the rose eats the semblance of all

If you don't understand the roster in the hightailed Rogers and out

Peoples of the iron brigade

Peoples ready for intersections

Peoples impossible to package

Peoples hopped on Hofmannsthal

I'm sorry the telegraph pooped out

The regulator listened without earphones

The basis points knocked on negligence

---

Sometimes the rice flow breaks the bank and boomerangs

Sometimes the tresses are only visible from behind

Sometimes eleven horsemen eat their parallax and cloister with Johnny
Come Lately

pillboxes
{: .ts4 }

Don't even oculate your susceptible Rangoon sandwich shop
bottle blast

Well take a lesson ya gotta do backwards and without the benefit of
segmentation

Well inside the icing and beyond the silver dollar

If you don't understand the farfetched effigy of our lighting and
prestidigitation

Peoples of the holding pattern

Peoples notwithstanding the possible

Peoples tried and true in their solution

I'm sorry the icicles leaked into the toystore

I'm sorry the icicles leaked for you

---

SOMETIMES red devils broker tolerance to new levels hollowing the Rogers

Just keep the mace for the pro forma bop before logic stresses regulars

So holdover lockets rupture puppy love for nine tools prepped for
oblongs

Well blackout the bicycle ya gotta do wholeheartedly

If you orange the seeming and don't understand Pellegrino

Peoples inside Davenport

Peoples of the blue kangaroo

Peoples riding the sink

I'm sorry horsemeat sings for you

## The T-Bone Shuffle

for T-Bone Walker
{: .forenote }

Let your hair down inside the box

Let your hair down the silly corridor

Not the sorry corridor

---

Your hair down possible Rogers and information

Your hair down Solomonic

Your hair down outside the register of this purple placeholder pining
away

---

For sure the Ryan Express and singalong

---

For sure the Rheingold refrigeration unit

For sure the Bellevue

For sure the Swiss

---

Fate's not my fave

Fate's got something to do with Morgan

Morgan the cheater who called in-balls out

---

Fate's a ride through the polygon

---

Fate's the driving position in the all-night candyland

the follicle in the dressing

the premium bouillon for our hostages

Fate's not destiny

Fate's not as good as destiny
