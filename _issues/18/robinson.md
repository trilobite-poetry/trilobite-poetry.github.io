## MARIAMA KABA

After Boubacar Traor√©
{: .forenote }

A heavy melancholy
{: .doublespace }

Dogs my steps
{: .doublespace }

From chicken-scratch yard
{: .doublespace }

To desert trek
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

A lonely path
{: .doublespace }

A sorry dance
{: .doublespace }

From Bamako
{: .doublespace }

To Paris, France
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

Always a visitor
{: .doublespace }

Never at home
{: .doublespace }

When I leave this place
{: .doublespace }

Which way shall I go?
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

Is this all there is?
{: .doublespace }

What can I say?
{: .doublespace }

A rag to wipe
{: .doublespace }

My tears away
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

The problem stems
{: .doublespace }

From an ancient curse
{: .doublespace }

To talk about it
{: .doublespace }

Would only make it worse
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

Soon it will be time
{: .doublespace }

For me to be on my way
{: .doublespace }

We will see one another
{: .doublespace }

Another day
{: .doublespace }

## BADINYAA KUMOO

After Sona Jobarteh
{: .forenote }

She is a *griot*
{: .doublespace }

Like her father before her
{: .doublespace }

A singer of songs
{: .doublespace }

A teller of tales of the tribe
{: .doublespace }

A tribe called everyone
{: .doublespace }

Within earshot
{: .doublespace }

A shot in the dark called time
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

Tracks on a path
{: .doublespace }

A voice in the night
{: .doublespace }

Fingers on skins on fire
{: .doublespace }

A matter of act
{: .doublespace }

A boom chank in unfolding time
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

Sing me a lullaby
{: .doublespace }

A lullaby for the child
{: .doublespace }

I used to be
{: .doublespace }

I will sing you a lullaby
{: .doublespace }

A lullaby for the child
{: .doublespace }

You used to be
{: .doublespace }

A lullaby that stretches into pain
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

A riverbed people
{: .doublespace }

Colonized for gain
{: .doublespace }

Remember old stories
{: .doublespace }

Songs' refrain
{: .doublespace }

Waiting in darkness
{: .doublespace }

For clouds to break open
{: .doublespace }

For liberating rain
{: .doublespace }

## RENDEZVOUS CHEZ FATIMATA

After Orquesta Aragon
{: .forenote }

Let's get together tonight
{: .doublespace }

At Fatimata's place
{: .doublespace }

The *son cubano* makes us happy
{: .doublespace }

Now you feel it
{: .doublespace }

The people are dancing
{: .doublespace }

Down thru the years
{: .doublespace }

A mix of *guarachas*
{: .doublespace }

The elegance of style
{: .doublespace }

The sky full of stars
{: .doublespace }

A moonlit night
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

My heart will never forget
{: .doublespace }

That feeling of happiness
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

Learn, boy
{: .doublespace }

Climb the scales
{: .doublespace }

Dance on the roof of the world
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

This music lends dignity to the proceedings
{: .doublespace }

Then explodes in a burst of joy
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

What are the odds?
{: .doublespace }

Who would have thought?
{: .doublespace }

Is there a parallel universe
{: .doublespace }

Where all the same things happen?
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

I'm not going off the deep end
{: .doublespace }

The rhythm of life continues
{: .doublespace }

Mountains of eventuality
{: .doublespace }

Stand out against a violet sky
{: .doublespace }

## BOLEROS PSICOD&eacute;LICOS

After Adrian Quesada
{: .forenote }

She enters to a seductive beat
{: .doublespace }

Stirring potentiality
{: .doublespace }

She wants it all
{: .doublespace }

The ocean, the sky above
{: .doublespace }

The dry sun
{: .doublespace }

Laughter like a motorcycle going away
{: .doublespace }

You didn't tell me
{: .doublespace }

What you like
{: .doublespace }

To spend time before it slips off
{: .doublespace }

As the ultimate girl would have it
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

Where are you?
{: .doublespace }

Where are you going
{: .doublespace }

With your love?
{: .doublespace }

Say no more of
{: .doublespace }

The solitude of your torments
{: .doublespace }

Under the sun
{: .doublespace }

You care only for adventure
{: .doublespace }

Do not forget me
{: .doublespace }

The drums signal from afar
{: .doublespace }

Thoughts of you surround me
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

This longing
{: .doublespace }

Is it slavery or love?
{: .doublespace }

These lips
{: .doublespace }

Want only
{: .doublespace }

The universe
{: .doublespace }

If only
{: .doublespace }

You would accept the truth
{: .doublespace }

The boy with sad eyes
{: .doublespace }

Has been trying to tell you
{: .doublespace }

On the water's edge
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

This sleepy fishing village
{: .doublespace }

Ends in a beach
{: .doublespace }

Cloaked in bougainvillea
{: .doublespace }

Under a clear blue sky
{: .doublespace }

This is where I see you
{: .doublespace }

Coming toward me
{: .doublespace }

Please continue your footsteps
{: .doublespace }

Right on up to my door
{: .doublespace }

My house is your house
{: .doublespace }

Now and forever
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

The longing you mention
{: .doublespace }

Is a way of resetting time
{: .doublespace }

To match the inner resources of this love
{: .doublespace }

That creeps and slithers into the shade
{: .doublespace }

The noon sun casts on the street
{: .doublespace }

She exits through that door
{: .doublespace }

Her mind is made up
{: .doublespace }

Of collective memories
{: .doublespace }

Of Japan, Malaysia, Colombia, France
{: .doublespace }

Places you can only imagine
{: .doublespace }

## MABANZO

After Juanita Euka
{: .forenote }

When you write about rain
{: .doublespace }

Don't forget about the tears
{: .doublespace }

You shed on the riverbank
{: .doublespace }

Or when moving between sound and bay
{: .doublespace }

The water moves fast through the channel
{: .doublespace }

Memories heap up
{: .doublespace }

Light on water releases the spirit
{: .doublespace }

Words slip the mind
{: .doublespace }

Like the loss of proper names
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

I would have given you the earth
{: .doublespace }

A walk on the word side
{: .doublespace }

We deploy the vocabulary
{: .doublespace }

Of an aging planet
{: .doublespace }

The people move from south to north
{: .doublespace }

Chord progressions in their wake
{: .doublespace }

Time to take stock
{: .doublespace }

Awareness of compression
{: .doublespace }

The soul of Africa
{: .doublespace }

From where we started
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

Even though we have no words
{: .doublespace }

For what is happening
{: .doublespace }

We cling to the earth's surface
{: .doublespace }

Consisting mainly of water
{: .doublespace }

That moves with the mind
{: .doublespace }

Under the sun
{: .doublespace }

Stretching across galaxies
{: .doublespace }

Laughing between waves
{: .doublespace }

Breaking the silence
{: .doublespace }

Of unpopulated space
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

The truth is real
{: .doublespace }

Only you can break the chain
{: .doublespace }

To soak your frame
{: .doublespace }

In a bath of recollections
{: .doublespace }

Admitting curlicues of thought
{: .doublespace }

The glory of life
{: .doublespace }

The crux of the matter
{: .doublespace }

Sailing away
{: .doublespace }

Over the tops of tall buildings
{: .doublespace }

The repetitions of the heart
{: .doublespace }
