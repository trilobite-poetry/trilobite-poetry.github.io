## Dead in the Eyes

I found him in my bed,

domesticated and shaking.

---

Followed his Western nose

until he reached my door.

---

His gun kicks you back

when you shoot it.

---

He pours gasoline into the open mouths

of the mourning.

---

Like most predators, he sleeps peacefully

when full.

## In Escrow

A wealth of personal problems. I am very motivated

by this prospect, despite the asbestos in the vinyl,

which can't be helped. We are all infused with a little poison.

Something died in the walls; fetid, sweet, it's chirping

at my nostrils. But look at the way the gate curves.

I would cut off my left arm for this property.

I would do anything, I mean anything

and I can tell by the look on your face,

you're interested.

## His Greedy Hand

I'm just like a man, searching for God in bed

Who is my keeper's keeper? His greedy hand

on my head. I wake up to his eyes, watching me

like an alligator in a Florida bathtub

He paints with the brush of the righteous;

moods like scripture.

## Proof by Exhaustion

Incidentally in a body

you've not yet reckoned with

Ancient ache to dry his tears

with your hair and eyelashes

Hungry child at the breast

of a reluctant Madonna

How the world was formed

fracturing against itself

Brute force

is the only force

## God in the Footprints

This isn't a world anyone longs to repopulate

and it doesn't love me enough

---

Anyone could find a sunset ugly and would

if it made sense at the time

---

The cat with one eye

The ultrasound scan of my ovary follicles

The jolie-laide

I bury my face in it all

---

When it goes you won't hear a sound

not even the hiss of air leaving your tires

---

I ran breathless

stopwatch in hand

---

Who gave the baby the car keys?
