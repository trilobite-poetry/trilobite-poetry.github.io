## Cognitive Pole Barn

<p class="prose-block" style="text-indent:2rem;">
I want to limit my survival of hot water uninhabited. Only then does
same-boated-ness imply winds at sails stalled.
</p>

<p class="prose-block" style="text-indent:2rem;">
I fight subconsciously the towing, medical jokes loud on the geriatric's
speakerphone. Our friendship in front of everyone impels others to
firmly encase shower spaces.
</p>

<p class="prose-block" style="text-indent:2rem;">
I ease those glassed-in, solved by police eliminating Daryl's free-demo
stock.
</p>

<p class="prose-block" style="text-indent:2rem;">
I even replace stuff sky-blue with clientele, empty air in favor of
peopled shell.
</p>

<p class="prose-block" style="text-align:center;">

Another framework in my fancy, expansively ascetic as food-stuffs
communally post-pie.
{: .prose-block }

But addicted-to-automated-robes is the event. The hell-like is shiftily
chocolate cart brocaded by giant turtle's flipside surf chaffing at
mechanisms of wheel by sandy worldview. Interpersonal grains figure
their parts as hollowed-out 'yup.'
{: .prose-block }

I sort of feel that the implementation of Uncle Ted's blue cheese fever
embeds the form of the reels within the inescapable Cadbury squiggle,
aging me out from being others'
"experience-of-the-repository-of-Incremental-encounters in differential
booths."

I'm always raving that our landscape is the best place to
civilize my own sense of a 'local peak.' The way I tend to rave
is evidence it's of value, for without the redoubt its bruteness
is no more peculiar than antler's crawl across redecoration's
lace. When I am raving, the salutation is deceptive redialing, in
which minds of folks find greatest case for ryegrass in the
first-person experience of illusory grind. Why I am attentive to
the contents of my own raving is that enough of the shifting
spotlight is unintentional mechanism of the cognitive pole barn.

## GP

Commonly its squeamish hands downstairs

Up from sneaking street

Just to withdraw folded cloth unmeant

For a spotted spoon of Manor

## 200 West

It is time to conclude results then wine

Inside of the dry-cleaned clothes and buffed shoes.

The finesse of illustrious body desked

To do something with a mouse

Daylit thought of future consequence.

Because is to do something, biscuit

On napkin by and by, crumbs not aloft

But in their crumby place...I know I want

To hear in Air Pods the tropical rain

And finger my dry pane longingly again.

## Annihilation

Unincluded in hindered profits

That continuous of service desk

Other plaints at the generalist detail.

The time away by scrub of redo; until

Honored incentive, via breakable thing,

Shifts in suitcase the lore at rest.

There is nothing voiced by clothes

Withstood of their articles

But breath in the threads; business

Of SSNs.

---

This hospitality is made uniform

by hand dressed to the wrist

in landline's cord.

## Poem

I can't write Christmas, in USA, by fields of sheep lain, interpreting
the Book, or in general to the extent cozily obeyed in the fewer lights
of night's tidings for whomsoever was dissolved in the account of
mother's child mild in the twice-mentioned sun gone, which serves as
prelude to desserts of the unconscious.

There's no letter addressed to the human armies; it'd be faced in
reluctance untranslated. Without such repairs to clarify the meaning,
palm-sized in the egg's own life, I soon had a little hunger beyond the
facts of a roasted recipe right. It surely would point to a closeable
loose-leaf, a pouch of its essence and/or personality, the same as seen
in phenomena of natural compound, the bundle renamed after its
sharpening, stripped of protective coating.
{: .prose-block }

No doubt above all I am inspired to endure my neighborly reader at the
swinging gates with instruments they can inundate with connective
breaths
{: .prose-block }

I ask her what that gun means to coworkers or to those otherwise
crucified with veterinary bills, through the clinic of heavy loads,
distressing treatment, emergency expenses, whether we need a foundation
to assist, if surgery salvaged a wonderful life of man's best friend, by
transfigurations bathed---does the vet agree, we can have Christmas? Or
after the fees will we recede and disappear altogether, discredited by
great practitioners of human standards, by fees they knew unpaid?
{: .prose-block }

This is still a happy tale, an embrace. And yet it signals nerves to
send pain to the brain. There's a popular version from one's own
childhood, surely meant uniquely for you, yet of no mere personal
benefit. The slow aged formation, slow aging of skin, the sugar in the
bloodstream the author chose to write---until that open palm, (now
closed), is no aqueduct of pity unwept, having been finally granted
honorable retirement.

## Algorithmic Tie-in

I have been to the Old Country Buffet at the Maine Mall and excused
myself, walking towards the stall. I am reminded that I am a veteran by
an old friend drying his hands. We leave the bathroom in search of
gloves at Sears, my friend decides.
{: .prose-block }

Having left empty-handed, the old friend suggests a detour to a fellow
vet's pad. This way he instructs, and we make our way down a small hall
tucked between where David's Bridal ends, and Best Buy begins.
{: .prose-block }

At the end of the hall is a storefront rollup spray-painted The Great
Service. My old friend lifts the unlocked metal rollup door. I want to
say hi to the guy he says.
{: .prose-block }

Inside is an unlit room filled with secondhand washing machines. My
friend enters, proceeding to one machine in particular. Crouching down
he yanks the washer back, revealing a trapdoor.
{: .prose-block }

Below the trapdoor is a space with dimensions greater than a casket but
smaller than a shower gurney. A shriveled bat-faced man with burn wounds
lay lifeless. He needs some air, says my friend. Then we each grab a
limb, ready for the weight.

## Intrinsic Coat

To skin stripped away

I shiver to worth-a-try

Inverted doorstep

A knocker at my eye
