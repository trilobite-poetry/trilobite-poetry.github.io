## Shipwrecks on the sphere of imagination

Freehand diagonals on a charcoal sky
{: .doublespace }

Follow a boy in sopping wool knocking on the inn door at the edge of
conflict
{: .doublespace }

Your halo-arrow circles and hovers, unsure
{: .doublespace }

who is the main player
{: .ts21 .nolinebreak .doublespace }

Oxblood on cobalt is a signature dish
{: .doublespace }

Squint at the horizon again, a dog harness hanging loosely on the torso
{: .doublespace }

The gritty of chains against scribbles of hair
{: .doublespace }

It's unclear how anything dries in the forever wet
{: .doublespace }

My face
{: .doublespace }

it's parts
{: .doublespace }

all over
{: .ts6 .doublespace }

we are looking through the wet screen and with a flick
{: .doublespace }

the images are swept away
{: .doublespace }

no drier than when they arrived here
{: .doublespace }

I love the charismatic dropout even as I long for massive participation
{: .doublespace }

Where they meet, unbalanced ships lean on each other
{: .doublespace }

First-person pirate perspective thuds to the surface
{: .doublespace }

\[distorted wind\]
{: .doublespace }

Dots of rough canvas where light pierces the port fog
{: .doublespace }

At night it's like the grey milk of a bartender's rag
{: .doublespace }

All reflections a zigzag and the buzz of a murder mosquito in winter
{: .doublespace }

Fangirling in the age of the shattered mind
{: .doublespace }

I draw a \<3 where my words used to be
{: .doublespace }

And where many of us walked along a shoreline or its idea
{: .doublespace }

{: .doublespace }

## String of cans

(writing through the Me and the Glassbirds album by Heejin Jang)
{: .forenote }

spider on the factory floor sorting through the hoarder's
attic containers that never made it to the
{: .doublespace }

radio on in a snowstorm and 1<sup>st</sup> person shooter on an old television
big wave coming in
{: .doublespace }

now with inquiry intensity someone's asking how did you get
here the pings of surveillance instead of
{: .doublespace }

hello somewhat crunchy landing of a high-rise stairwell income of a set
painter on strike off for a
{: .doublespace }

month of work whirr of core systems old pipes sparks spray auto shop
while you hold a bag of Produce
{: .doublespace }

Junction potatoes plucking the grid tines of a shopping cart emptying
the last of the boba cup OMing
{: .doublespace }

face down rubber mat slow motion fly zapper shoes in a bouncy castle
rattling the differences
{: .doublespace }

between temple bell and train crossing cans rattling down the road
afternoon a skateboarder's
{: .doublespace }

cruise notification hiccups against lug soled sneakers skid lino as the
KIA mockingbird alarm staggers
{: .doublespace }

rubbing the edges of a HVAC filter dribbling the balls and the intervals
of tunnel lights is interminable
{: .doublespace }

interference is welcome the cold air outside a club re-entry escalator
when you try going up and
{: .doublespace }

starlit walls everywhere deep-sea fishing everywhere contact mics stuck
in the blankets motor
{: .doublespace }

revving summit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cold face indifferent face unwell heart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slivers
flying fish&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mass of people
{: .doublespace }

tapping the bus crushed by the last tree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whereabouts of an uneasy
violin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warehouse
{: .doublespace }

district that moment in Heat (1995) when the cops saw themselves being
seen Val Kilmer's ponytail
{: .doublespace }

car sliding sideways eggs moving off a plate the leaking gutter in
gurgle of attached houses boom
{: .doublespace }

bap bibimbap bath time for fisheries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a chirp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the looming device&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warp
going back ages that ghost
{: .doublespace }

drag or the largest latte art the sky is ad space swiping everything
gets nailed down before the big
{: .doublespace }

suction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the big sitar riff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;churn marks to remind players jangle the crab&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shell and crescent
{: .doublespace }

we live in present time only some of the time and move shapes around
obstructed ducts into exhaust
{: .doublespace }
