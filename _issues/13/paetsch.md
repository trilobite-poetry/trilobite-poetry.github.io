*Crumb Boss Vlon* turns to the clerk: "*Fremin*, take you down this *my
testament*? \[*Fremin glances at his restraints*\] Never mind! *Item*,
this *my* *testameat*, that I threaten again to raze, that feeds us no
more than Marine Snow, *deposit at the precinct that it might precede
us*. \[*Fremin glances at his restraints*\] Enough! Thus, *Item*, so
that the tax I levy (without having the authority to do so) upon this my
*Counter-System* not go to waste, wheel at once yourself & anyone in
your vicinity to a cross-roads. Once there after drinking *five hours*
clasp (or let fall into your clasp) a *mark* (really any *gull*, ideally
one 'not that into cam-work') and, thinking he pays for that one round,
pays for it and all preceding. *Show him then choice feeds* .... Would
that were all! No---with the *mark* well in the *rat-trap*, his estate
broken into pieces, have fellow vermin muster up & sit in triumph with
your *prisoner* and, under color of showing him favor (as is called:
*waiting for bail*), you & your leeches swallow 6 gallons more! Your
mark (now become *agent*) chafing at waiting so long for his *Bail*
begins to suspect he could transcribe this *My Testament* within the
limits of a walnut & make a pesto of it. Begins to worry too that
*Creditor's Militia* might press-gang him into their ranks herd him into
debtor's prison & towards canal-life." Vlon turns to the prisoner: "But
that's not possible is it *Fremin*? \[*glances at his restraints*\]
Never mind! To the *cricket-faced bailiff* who hauled me in for my
debts, *Item*, pine-mulch to cover his tracks. He'll be keen to scatter
it behind him once skimming from the commissary & plundering the
evidence locker. Can you blame him? \[*Fremin glances at his restraints,
Vlon at the earth*\] Lord mother \[*he bellows*\] once I follow that
track to the bailiff's pine box let me in! *shoe-horn my box atop his*.
I'm keen to piss in his pine-box ... keen as I was years ago to do so in
all five corners of Val's *shore condo* & many clepsydras besides ....
Anyway when my debt runs dry I'll, *Item*, seal his hull as totally as
*burning my precinct* my fate (no amount of piss to put out that fire!)
then collect---*unless they find me first!* I exempt no one not even
Fate (assuming *Fate* not *Debt* hounds my life's trails). So ... *to
whatever tracks me across featureless plains* I leave, *Item*, a body if
not a life to pay this ransom once and for all ... & if that's not
enough, *Item*, I lend it this story on credit. *Don't be afraid to find
a little bit of yourself in this my story*:
{: .prose-block }

Eyes twitch towards the grate. Flyrt bites his lip. "Erx*p&eacute;c*ting
someone?" Flyrt shakes off a sign. *Dangerous play* I tell him *for
one strapped to a chair* .... Best case for us here: that *fetid mass*
sprung from the beds of the *embalmed counter-earth* (canal) surging
now towards the surface (city) be neither *Creditor* nor
*Angel-Investor* nor *Proxy-Ward* but *Testator*, "Don't" I warn him
"tip them off." Flyrt bites his lip. I nod to Vlon who flips a switch.
"Why" Vlon yells over the machine "tase Flyrt?" Flyrt not hearing
through the pain I speak freely: "We're hoping he tips off the *fetid
mass*. The more organic fibers stippling this debtor's body
\[*gestures at Flyrt*\] the more leverage over it. I almost feel bad
for it---cosigning to fetid middens, no amount of skin-grafts or
Botoxins to free him from it. We just need to strip away everything
inorganic ...." Some months later *fetid mass Flyrt* passes through a
"grate" (bosonic field) near Vert's chuckwagon. That grate strips it
of everything inorganic. We confront it. *Not* *like us to worry over
the sacking of a sugar tit when* fetid mass *nurses whole pap* .... It
fingers us; *we catch case*. Try parsing (I say) *unadulterated
bio-acoustic pulses* & other *archaic declensions* before saying we
have something to go on! *Nothing* Vert sees *to go on* .... We take
the case anyway. *Bailiff Lyf* rings us in: "*Next on the docket*:

"*Bailiff Lyf*" chirps the Judge "*keep my traffic moving!*" My turn.
"Can you identify the defendant." "Not since" I say "*grate* stripped
it of everything identifiable." *I don't care* (Vert defiant now) how
winding tightly a vagrant & shoving it through a grate endows it with
enough force to scramble its chirality decant itself into
multiply-stratified wave-fronts. "Bless you Vert." *Better to air out
this case here than when shackled to a radiator* .... Time-grates
conjugate the *wards* & *churls* (*I don't understand the mechanics
behind it*) now barking now parsing the sentences that'd negate the
*paradigmatic* *equations* written into the world's foundations. If
that's not *dealing oneself a losing hand* *in this ill-starred world*
then I don't know up from down frowntown from upside-down-town
roughside up rightside out down .... *Debtors-on-feed-tubes* gasp for
something to foul the feed. There's only this: *In girum imus nocte et
consumimur igni*---*we turn in the circle by night & are consumed by
the fire*. More noise floods ill-begotten worlds. *Incurable
rinderpest of a geometry, once seated at the table, amidst all noise
and slag, decaying drags us down with it* .... I hope you liked my
fucking story! *Did you see a little bit of yourself in it?*
{: .prose-block .ts4 }

If not, *Item*, I give to you Clone Gall \[*checks notes*\] noise
swamping *Warden's* signal. Vrey never could disentangle the two. And so
he inherits, *Item*, the thread that unravels it? *even if it ain't*
*Warden's meaning just yet?* Jest you wait! meanwhile wind yourself into
*immense background radiation* striding forth now & then to imprint
itself on flesh inscribe itself on bark sign itself on shore lost in fog
founder on shoals fledge itself & sink out of sight to be gnawed at last
by the great *fog-skinned cop* himself *Warden Creature*:

My play. I flick the lights off & on. Vlon's bleached torso darkens the
threshold. Plain to see he's ratted us out .... I humor him anyway:

{: .prose-block-no-linespace }

<p style="text-indent:3rem;" class="prose-block-no-linespace">
<em>What a life</em> .... How near was I to having had enough? <em>Strike out</em>
</p>

<p style="text-indent:3rem;" class="prose-block">
without, *Item*, the object of this inquiry! Likely all I have left, I
guess, though not mine to give, since unattainable .... Yet I say to you
*Take freely from it & spurn it, this my Testament, that will be
testated in memory of me*. So to Vrey leave, *Item*, the vanishingly
small stakes in the results of this inquiry. In whichever future he
claims it there'll be exactly as much left of it as there will be of me,
which is exactly as much as I'm leaving him now, just in the future.
That's not a salve but a solvent if you catch my drift .... Would that
they measure my sentence by the clepsydra I piss in periodically!
\[*Fremin indicates that this would lengthen his sentence*\] Never mind!
*Sloughing off skins* (like as I have) *lets you feel anew the body's
horror at becoming sentient* which is how it's always been, or will be,
I suppose .... *Far better to be mere matter,* I suppose, *some
anonymous cyst bubbling in the nearest vortex not a thought for leaving
anything behind* ... *except,* Item*, this one larva we spackle into the
corner of the spytell-house; if only because they opened for us the road
to it, as they opened it for all vagabonds, truants, ruggers, rufflers,
faitours, auriums and patricos (false priests), hedge-creepers, clones,
filocks and lusks. Mark them as they file in: pock-eaten flesh & rind,
lousy & scald & peeléd like as apes, dragging bag & staff---they might
metamorphose still, if given a hint. You think you know me? & yet all
the while on the ground, which is my mother's grate, one knocks with his
staff both early and late, crying "Leve mother let me in, how I vanish
in flesh & blood & skin." How's that for a return on investment! Nothing
left in the bag but,* Item*, tactical skeleton key. Why want that? When
they cuff you to the wheel, angle the car towards the culvert and
release the brake you'll see! If not here's your fate: adjuncts (off
script for sure!) tongue your body as it surfaces and---tonguing alike
the underside of solar winds & heliospheric current sheets---class you
amongst presently-deliquescing organisms. You get what you pay for!
Anyway I don't pretend to give you a choice but only,* Item*, what we
scrubbed from Warden's signal. Rather than discard it I arrange it here,
as if in a circle around your pit, or some other shape, noise though it
is, so that those passing by can take of it and sleep well, knowing that
what's beclouding their head isn't this, or if it is it's sequestered in
a pit, at least until a vagabond's staff fructify it, and one more bruit
expressing negatively the geometry of Warden's sigil bounces off
rain-blackened pines:*
