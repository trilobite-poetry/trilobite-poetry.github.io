<h2>On Mondays the Sunriselady takes a break</h2>
<div style="max-width:650px;">
<p class="ts3">To watch you die</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak">Not to cause it</p>
<p class="ts26 nolinebreak">It can’t be caused</p>
<p class="ts3 just">And just as there are no more secrets to tell in the shadows of the valley of the</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">dead</p>
<p class="ts7 nolinebreak">She carries two large melons for the journey</p>
<p class="ts30 nolinebreak just">There are two</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">ships facing the wrong way</p>
<p class="ts18 nolinebreak">But you won’t be taking the sea</p>
<p class="ts3">so Death is an ornament for the roots</p>
<p class="ts30 nolinebreak">O wrong silence</p>
<p class="ts3">She woke you from dreams of tropical cyclones</p>
<p class="ts30 nolinebreak just">She has too little</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">ground herself</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak">and You have plenty to go down</p>
<p class="ts30 nolinebreak just">Open mouthed</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">for good emergency</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak">Kindred fruit of life and memory ferment together</p>
<p class="ts3">She arrived with hair cut close to her skin</p>
<p class="ts22 nolinebreak">Now her hair is long and dark</p>
<p class="ts7">You have too little escape Words ornament your dying like stored</p>
<p class="ts3">grist to resist the long gloss of winter</p>
<p class="ts22 nolinebreak just">With her she brought a wardrobe</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">of messages for the end</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak just">If you refuse the death you will be read as many</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak just">limbs of the same instructions as you need Each floor down a new monster</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">who mothers</p>
<p class="ts11 nolinebreak">each floor</p>
<p class="ts18 nolinebreak just">Shoulders for a new bird and Hands for a</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">new blade</p>
<p class="ts11 nolinebreak">When we descend</p>
<p class="ts22 nolinebreak">It is clear</p>
<p class="ts30 nolinebreak just">The roots of you</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">talk to the roots of me</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak">These roots hold jury Pool the warm phlegm of 
Us</p>
<p class="ts3">though you have been told of a sickness incurable</p>
<p class="ts30 nolinebreak just">It is clear Apples</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">have a core</p>
<p class="ts18 nolinebreak">Roots miter escape from love</p>
<p class="ts32 nolinebreak">She</p>
<p class="ts3">reminds you of shared body</p>
<p class="ts18 nolinebreak">Twice a day the light hits you the same</p>
<p class="ts7">She watches you and though she is not allowed to guide you Her</p>
<p class="ts3">twilight nods to the right</p>
<p class="ts18 nolinebreak">and so to the right you kick your feet</p>

<h2 id="we-tell-the-other-person-to-choose-where-well-live-next">We tell the other person to choose where we’ll live next</h2>
<p>there is one thing left on my list before children</p>
<hr />
<p>I require Paris</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts8">I require Mary Magdalene’s skull</p>
<hr />
<p>to cry in her grotto in the South of France to light a candle for
myself</p>
<p>and whomever else I think of next</p>
<hr />
<p><em>for the children of the mudslide</em></p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts16"><em>for the people of Poland</em></p>
<p><em>for the man I passed who confessed to me</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I am grateful for this medication that is working</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts23">I am bleeding naturally again</p>
<p>though the root cause of the issue has not been addressed</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts27">though no one
is sure of the root cause</p>
<p>of my body so disconnected from its nature</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts23">still my cycle does not
harmonize with the moon</p>
<p>or anything I need to do</p>
<hr />
<p>I want to live where I allow myself to be moved</p>
<p>which should not be mistaken for wanting to move where I am allowed to
live</p>
<hr />
<p>I found a stone that is alien to our earth</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts23">I asked it to do what it
needs to do</p>
<p>to bring me all the love and support I need</p>
<hr />
<p>but nothing is changing   worlds are moving</p>
<hr />
<p>I require so many people in one body</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts18">I asked my husband if he’d be
upset if I became Catholic</p>
<hr />
<p>and not just for the gilded tangibility of it</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts23">not just for the
surrender</p>
<p>not just because Mary Lou Williams created “St. Martin de Porres” after
she was so moved to convert</p>
<hr />
<p>not just because these hormonal swells and collapses create a frequency
of catharsis that I cannot maintain</p>
<p>unless a child or a divine work is produced</p>
<hr />
<p>what is this habit of commitment?</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts18">I hate how often I have to quit the
smallest things</p>
<p>I want what happens when you see the same people</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts27">in frequence in presence of the same people</p>
<p>it’s not that I want to be a nun</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts15">just that I’d like to live in a monastery inside the Île de la Cité</p>
<hr />
<p>do I have to build everything I want for myself?</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts23">or, do I want to build everything myself?</p>
<hr />
<p>somewhere to be like not having to worry about breakfast</p>
<p>a water source</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts8">and birds to talk to</p>
<p>a husband to complain about</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts15">when my body denies its orders</p>
<hr />
<p>maybe children for the wildness</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts15">noise canceling headphones for their father</p>
<hr />
<p>I like the loudness of many people myself</p>
<h2 id="im-not-allowed-to-forget-the-best-parts-of-me-with-you-around">I’m not allowed to forget the best parts of me with you around</h2>
<p>I remember the name of the James River only because it <em>does not</em> rhyme
with other</p>
<p>rivers I’ve been drunk on. My first 44 thoughts from bed this morning</p>
<hr />
<p>remind me of how cruel I can be. To my body: so flat against the floor,
no melody.</p>
<p>What narratives I tell this self when limited to just 44 moments of
shitmouth!</p>
<hr />
<p><em>I am a fungus person</em>— far from G-d!</p>
<hr />
<p>I need a hand. Would you offer me the lost times where I was a kind</p>
<p>rabbit slipping under the fence to find you good things?</p>
<hr />
<p>Please. Will you remind me of the times I gave you the blue bowl,</p>
<p>the only one I liked at all? It occurs to me that all of my friends
(yes, you)</p>
<hr />
<p>could be proof I am Virtue Herself. Look at you, all of you avatars of
grace.</p>
<p>Wearing shorts in March! Cold wind up your sleeves as you wave</p>
<hr />
<p>across the river James to me. I offer you the time</p>
<p>I was a <em>Total BitchTM</em> and you swat it away.</p>
<hr />
<p>I could see that my friends (yes, you, yes) are reasons to believe I am
mushroom joy.</p>
<p>Millenia rosy! Under the soil and <em>all about</em></p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts22">popping up,</p>
<hr />
<p>up everywhere</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts11">about us</p>
<p class="nolinebreak ts19">all. I am world. La la!</p>
<p>I am the green jello salad that someone (was it you?) said should be
made</p>
<hr />
<p>with cottage cheese and we just kept up the joke! Ha ha!</p>
<p>Don’t mind me: I am the bright bursts of mandarin oranges from the can!</p>
<hr />
<p>La LA! You laugh with me as we pulley-system the blue bowl</p>
<p>back and forth across the James. Just look at us! The heart-pumps of
G-d.</p>
<h2>I'm moving somewhere that holds no memory for me.</h2>
<div style="max-width:500px;">
<p class="ts6">Imagine pain as temporary</p>
<p class="ts20 nolinebreak just">The pain of not</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">knowing how long <em>temporary</em> is floods in</p>
<p class="ts6 just">And moaning could mean any one of a million</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">things</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak just">This: I can't remember what</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">I've said to whom</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak just">Or, if I have damned myself</p>
<p class="ts7 nolinebreak">I hated being drunk</p>
<p class="ts20 nolinebreak just">But I loved getting</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">there A clear sky can still be</p>
<p class="ts23 nolinebreak just">A waste of</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">space</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak just">They say: moaning deepens</p>
<p class="ts7 nolinebreak">the sense that I'm done</p>
<p class="ts23 nolinebreak just">The last</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">time I flew</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak just">My sweat smelled like my</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">gone grandmother's</p>
<p class="ts20 nolinebreak just">I've never seen a</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">ghost</p>
<p class="ts15 nolinebreak just">Though I believe they haunt</p>
<p class="ts9 nolinebreak">Hoping to finish business</p>
<p class="ts7">Sooner rather than later</p>
<p class="ts20 nolinebreak just">Too many people</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">remember more about me than I do</p>
<p class="ts6">While I've lived here</p>
<p class="ts23 nolinebreak just">My friends</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak just">have a different friendship with me than the one I</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">have with them</p>
<p class="ts20 nolinebreak just">I'm not often the</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">person I'm talking to</p>
<p class="ts23 nolinebreak just">And I</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">could talk for endlessnesses</p>
<p class="ts23 nolinebreak just">Even at a</p>
<p class="ts6 nolinebreak">long distance</p>

<h2>The first to show up, the last to leave.</h2>
<div style="max-width:700px;">
<p class="ts3 just">I move so fast my lamentations are a music video / I am all
the backup dancers
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak just">on the stage / at once / all of me dressed in this bitter
grief / as costume / I am</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak just">also the tech team / also the whole stage crew / I
fly in these crystal</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">chandeliers / the size of God's clear and weeping
teeth</p>
<hr />
<p class="ts3">Don't tell me we lived a good life together / she's not
breathing.</p>
<hr />
<p class="ts6 just">Equal and opposite / I intend a poison so long lasting and if I</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">couldn't get away from her death / at least I could take over.</p>
<hr />
<p class="ts3 just">When I was an oil spill / I was the most at-home / <em>what an oil spill I am</em>, I'd</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak just">say / I sizzled as an oil spill / the crowd loved all of me / all my organs flat</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak just">against the water / slapping / pinned to the world / I move so fast around the</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak just">globe! / I am expressed as all the backup dancers in the world / on one stage at</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">once! / and we are sobbing in song!</p>
<hr />
<p class="ts3 just">And someone had to die for this treat / didn't you also sense the whole world</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak just">grieving over the same thing / at once / only a few years ago? / didn't you</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak just">already know that the same sludge was snapping back? / maybe you're still in</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">the parts of the world I remain / covering.</p>
<hr />
<p class="ts3 just">So I rock my belly over one hip / over the other / a little bit slower this time /</p>
<p class="ts3 nolinebreak">a little bit slower this time / my ankles into the ground / a finalist of loss.</p>
