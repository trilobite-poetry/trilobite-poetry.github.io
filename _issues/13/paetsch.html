<p class="prose-block"><em>Crumb Boss Vlon</em> to <em>Fremin</em>: “Take you
down this <em>my testament</em>? [<em>Fremin glances
at his restraints</em>] Never mind! <em>Item</em>, this <em>my</em>
<em>testameat</em>, that I threaten again to raze, that feeds us no more than
Marine Snow, <em>deposit at the precinct that it might precede us</em>.
[<em>Fremin glances at his restraints</em>] Enough! Thus, <em>Item</em>, so
that the tax I levy (without having the authority to do so) upon this my
<em>Counter-System</em> not go to waste, wheel at once yourself &amp; anyone in
your vicinity to a cross-roads. Once there after drinking <em>five hours</em>
clasp (or let fall into your clasp) a <em>mark</em> (really any <em>gull</em>,
ideally one ‘not that into cam-work’) and, thinking he pays for that one round,
pays for it and all preceding. <em>Show him then choice feeds</em> …. Would
that were all! No—with the <em>mark</em> well in the <em>rat-trap</em>, his
estate broken into pieces, have fellow vermin muster up &amp; sit in triumph
with your <em>prisoner</em> and, under color of showing him favor (as is
called: <em>waiting for bail</em>), you &amp; your leeches swallow 6 gallons
more! Your mark (now become <em>agent</em>) chafing at waiting so long for his
<em>Bail</em> begins to suspect he could transcribe this <em>My Testament</em>
within the limits of a walnut &amp; make a pesto of it. Begins to worry too
that <em>Creditor’s Militia</em> might press-gang him into their ranks herd him
into debtor’s prison &amp; towards canal-life.” Vlon turns to the prisoner:
“But that’s not possible is it <em>Fremin</em>? [<em>glances at his
restraints</em>] Never mind! To the <em>cricket-faced bailiff</em> who hauled
me in for my debts, <em>Item</em>, pine-mulch to cover his tracks. He’ll be
keen to scatter it behind him once skimming from the commissary &amp;
plundering the evidence locker. Can you blame him? [<em>Fremin glances at his
restraints, Vlon at the earth</em>] Lord mother [<em>he bellows</em>] once I
follow that track to the bailiff’s pine box let me in! <em>shoe-horn my box
  atop his</em>. I’m keen to piss in his pine-box … keen as I was years ago to
do so in all five corners of Val’s <em>shore condo</em> &amp; many clepsydras
besides …. Anyway when my debt runs dry I’ll, <em>Item</em>, seal his hull as
totally as <em>burning my precinct</em> my fate (no amount of piss to put out
that fire!) then collect—<em>unless they find me first!</em> I exempt no one
not even Fate (assuming <em>Fate</em> not <em>Debt</em> hounds my life’s
trails). So … <em>to whatever tracks me across featureless plains</em> I leave,
<em>Item</em>, a body if not a life to pay this ransom once and for all … &amp;
if that’s not enough, <em>Item</em>, I lend it this story on credit. <em>Don’t
  be afraid to find a little bit of yourself in this my story</em>:</p>

<p class="prose-block ts4">Eyes twitch towards the grate. Flyrt bites his lip.
“Erx<em>péc</em>ting someone?” Flyrt shakes off a sign. <em>Dangerous play</em>
I tell him <em>for one strapped to a chair</em> …. Best case for us here: that
<em>fetid mass</em> sprung from the beds of the <em>embalmed counter-earth</em>
(canal) surging now towards the surface (city) be neither <em>Creditor</em> nor
<em>Angel-Investor</em> nor <em>Proxy-Ward</em> but <em>Testator</em>, “Don’t”
I warn him “tip them off.” Flyrt bites his lip. I nod to Vlon who flips a
switch. “Why” Vlon yells over the machine “tase Flyrt?” Flyrt not hearing
through the pain I speak freely: “We’re hoping he tips off the <em>fetid
mass</em>. The more organic fibers stippling this debtor’s body [<em>gestures
at Flyrt</em>] the more leverage over it. I almost feel bad for it—cosigning to
fetid middens, no amount of skin-grafts or Botoxins to free him from it. We
just need to strip away everything inorganic ….” Some months later <em>fetid
  mass Flyrt</em> passes through a “grate” (bosonic field) near Vert’s
chuckwagon. That grate strips it of everything inorganic. We confront it.
<em>Not</em> <em>like us to worry over the sacking of a sugar tit when</em>
fetid mass <em>nurses whole pap</em> …. It fingers us; <em>we catch case</em>.
Try parsing (I say) <em>unadulterated bio-acoustic pulses</em> &amp; other
<em>archaic declensions</em> before saying we have something to go on!
<em>Nothing</em> Vert sees <em>to go on</em> …. We take the case anyway.
<em>Bailiff Lyf</em> rings us in: “<em>Next on the docket</em>:</p>

<p class="ts10"><em>Carsolved Mysteries, Case 1</em></p>

<hr />

<p class="ts10">‘Cam didn’t see him.’</p>

<p class="ts10"><em>Case closed</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p class="ts10"><em>Carsolved Mysteries, Case 2</em></p>

<hr />

<p class="ts10">‘Not really seeing he cam here.’</p>

<p class="ts10"><em>Case closed</em>.”</p>

<hr />

<p class="prose-block ts4">“<em>Bailiff Lyf</em>” chirps the Judge “<em>keep my
traffic moving!</em>” My turn. “Can you identify the defendant.” “Not since”
I say “<em>grate</em> stripped it of everything identifiable.” <em>I don’t
care</em> (Vert defiant now) how winding tightly a vagrant &amp; shoving it
through a grate endows it with enough force to scramble its chirality decant
itself into multiply-stratified wave-fronts. “Bless you Vert.” <em>Better to
air out this case here than when shackled to a radiator</em> …. Time-grates
conjugate the <em>wards</em> &amp; <em>churls</em> (<em>I don’t understand the
mechanics behind it</em>) now barking now parsing the sentences that’d negate
the <em>paradigmatic</em> <em>equations</em> written into the world’s
foundations. If that’s not <em>dealing oneself a losing hand</em> <em>in this
ill-starred world</em> then I don’t know up from down frowntown from
upside-down-town roughside up rightside out down ….
<em>Debtors-on-feed-tubes</em> gasp for something to foul the feed. There’s
only this: <em>In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni</em>—<em>we turn in the
circle by night &amp; are consumed by the fire</em>. More noise floods
ill-begotten worlds. <em>Incurable rinderpest of a geometry, once seated at
the table, amidst all noise and slag, decaying drags us down with it</em>
…. I hope you liked my fucking story! <em>Did you see a little bit of
yourself in it?</em></p>

<p class="prose-block">If not, <em>Item</em>, I give to you Clone Gall
[<em>checks notes</em>] noise swamping <em>Warden’s</em> signal. Vrey never
could disentangle the two. And so he inherits, <em>Item</em>, the thread that
unravels it? <em>even if it ain’t</em> <em>Warden’s meaning just yet?</em> Jest
you wait! meanwhile wind yourself into <em>immense background radiation</em>
striding forth now &amp; then to imprint itself on flesh inscribe itself on
bark sign itself on shore lost in fog founder on shoals fledge itself &amp;

<p class="prose-block-no-linespace">—Ods belly man you talk here of
<em>Testaments</em>? When in danger it behoveth us to bestir our stumps lustily
or never.</p>

<p class="ts2 prose-block-no-linespace">Vrey says nothing.</p>

<p class="prose-block-no-linespace">—I mean, the most <em>minimal geometry</em>
should rule it out! Yet we bathe in signals of ever lesser quality ….</p>

<p style="text-indent:2rem;" class="prose-block-no-linespace"> My play. I flick
the lights off &amp; on. Vlon's bleached torso darkens the threshold. Plain to
see he's ratted us out .... I humor him anyway: </p>

<p class="prose-block-no-linespace">—Bleached torsos ain’t cheap. You rat on us all or just me?</p>

<p class="prose-block-no-linespace">—Ill-testated ill-starred &amp; ill-begotten <em>corpus</em> if the <em>System</em> that
nutated it slipt into my precinct’s feed I’d reach for the fissile
material ….</p>

<p class="prose-block-no-linespace">—I’m asking the questions here.</p>

<p style="text-indent:2rem;" class="prose-block-no-linespace">
<em>What a life</em> .... How near was I to having had enough? <em>Strike out</em>
</p>

<p class="ts2 prose-block-no-linespace">for <em>lightless hadal zones</em></p>

<p style="text-indent:2rem;" class="prose-block">
without, <em>Item</em>, the object of this inquiry! Likely all I have left, I
guess, though not mine to give, since unattainable .... Yet I say to you
<em>Take freely from it &amp; spurn it, this my Testament, that will be
testated in memory of me</em>. So to Vrey leave, <em>Item</em>, the vanishingly
small stakes in the results of this inquiry. In whichever future he
claims it there'll be exactly as much left of it as there will be of me,
which is exactly as much as I'm leaving him now, just in the future.
That's not a salve but a solvent if you catch my drift .... Would that
they measure my sentence by the clepsydra I piss in periodically!
[<em>Fremin indicates that this would lengthen his sentence</em>] Never mind!
<em>Sloughing off skins</em> (like as I have) <em>lets you feel anew the body's
horror at becoming sentient</em> which is how it's always been, or will be,
I suppose .... <em>Far better to be mere matter,</em> I suppose, <em>some
anonymous cyst bubbling in the nearest vortex not a thought for leaving
anything behind</em> ... <em>except,</em> Item<em>, this one larva we spackle into the
corner of the spytell-house; if only because they opened for us the road
to it, as they opened it for all vagabonds, truants, ruggers, rufflers,
faitours, auriums and patricos (false priests), hedge-creepers, clones,
filocks and lusks. Mark them as they file in: pock-eaten flesh &amp; rind,
lousy &amp; scald &amp; peeléd like as apes, dragging bag &amp; staff---they might
metamorphose still, if given a hint. You think you know me? &amp; yet all
the while on the ground, which is my mother's grate, one knocks with his
staff both early and late, crying "Leve mother let me in, how I vanish
in flesh &amp; blood &amp; skin." How's that for a return on investment! Nothing
left in the bag but,* Item*, tactical skeleton key. Why want that? When
they cuff you to the wheel, angle the car towards the culvert and
release the brake you'll see! If not here's your fate: adjuncts (off
script for sure!) tongue your body as it surfaces and---tonguing alike
the underside of solar winds &amp; heliospheric current sheets---class you
amongst presently-deliquescing organisms. You get what you pay for!
Anyway I don't pretend to give you a choice but only,* Item*, what we
scrubbed from Warden's signal. Rather than discard it I arrange it here,
as if in a circle around your pit, or some other shape, noise though it
is, so that those passing by can take of it and sleep well, knowing that
what's beclouding their head isn't this, or if it is it's sequestered in
a pit, at least until a vagabond's staff fructify it, and one more bruit
expressing negatively the geometry of Warden's sigil bounces off
rain-blackened pines:*
