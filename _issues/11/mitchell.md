## a

> Time doesn't match the pacing, pit stains flower into fragrance,
> leaflets deck the halls. The umbilical cord pulls tight against the
> violin bow like a chokehold. Carpet stays dirty and the hairs go gray.
> Mina watches her baby suckle and wonders if fairies slowly burn across
> the sky. Steam unspools from the spout and the sunset curtsies away.
> Nothing romantic, just the swell of soap as it blows into bubbles.
> Digital lightning bolts pixelate as Mina's mind drifts to the power of
> witchcraft. A dull butter knife dashes between fingers; your pinky is
> as thick as a carrot. She drives to the grocery store with wet hair
> and clamps the girdled roll across her stomach, reminding her of a
> mammogram. Dinosaurs lament their plastic form. Nothing sounds good.
> The sign above the aisle doesn't list all of the items. My name
> belongs to someone else and all these words are borrowed.

## b

> Drown the basement. The cave is an ocean. I got lost looking for the
> opening. Teeth come in as they go. Spit on your nails to make them
> shiny. Aphrodite gives birth to a bull in a maze, are you afraid of
> the dark? Father on all fours. Dust the Siamese cat for good fortune.
> Declawed paws are tongueless. Ornaments bob in the bathtub. Barbie's
> hair grows back. Mina texts a truck driver. Second cousins, not first.
> Once removed. He receives the message in Iowa and poses in front of a
> Christmas tree, thinking of her. Frozen pizza burns the roof of his
> mouth, tongue the ridges.

## c

> The trophy is topped with a little gold rifle. The barrel goes into
> his urethra, now a big brother. The Patriot Act is put into place. I
> hold my ear to the wall. Teresa's dull crotch is covered in red. Posh
> stripped naked. I chase myself out of the house. Memory is not our
> own. I remember pretending to write before I knew how to, convincing
> scribbles: a story in crayon. Cardboard bricks topple. What if I pee
> standing up? Bush reads a book, *The Pet Goat* -- He eats everything
> in his path until it turns into desert. Soggy cereal. Pluck elastics
> off brackets and run braceless. White squares of enamel surrounded by
> yellow. My foot is in my mouth. Toe rings clatter. Shake the sandy
> sheets. Flatulence fans itself. Algae lines the ass crack. I lick my
> lifeline. The crease deepens with closed hands.

## d

> What is lemonade without the sugar? Her smile smears across diamonds.
> The shine is felt like metal on molars. Shopping carts crash. Mina
> photographs her shape, contorting the sides and thighs. He replies to
> his cousin. The burp carries sadness. Infomercials splay dildos.
> Vibrating tubes sit atop cotton clouds, the jack rabbit gnashes, teeth
> grind, basilica quakes. Our chimney is struck and falls into the
> field. Corn never comes again. The windows look in. He trims his
> nails, the cold air on exposed skin reminds him of purple newborns.
> Birth was a bold move. Ten and two. He buys a sheet of stamps with
> exact change. Lady Liberty speaks French. Furthermore, she's a Roman
> goddess. We borrow and thus we owe.

## e

> Discovery is made while flossing. Legs spread for the full-length
> mirror. Does my pinkness match my mother's. Inherited labia.
> Grandmother folds. Burgers spill out of the greasy bottomed bag. Smoke
> plumes, the car stinks. Sue doesn't taste the fries, wipes her hands
> on black pants. Wedding bands clink in the basin, porcelain stains
> green. Earth appears as a dot between
> the [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#G_Ring) and [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#E_Ring) rings
> of Saturn. The ceiling hits the floor. Strings are man made to begin
> with --- hand-stitched dress sits with old mothballs, its fumes
> filling my mouth. The box doesn't expand, only thickens. Lightheaded
> fluorescence. Take the next exit. Airbags await causation.

## f

> Does the dish fall or is it thrown? Her soapy hand counts to three.
> Sweeping blondness, necks crane. Mina privately pirouettes in new
> shoes (Reeboks) and walks around the state fair alone, sitting on
> various park benches, watching teens share a foot-long corn dog. Where
> does it all go? Skyride selfies. Skirt the margins with a pencil,
> standardization blurs all of the bubbles into one big spot. Cataract.
> Correct. The center of the tissue is used but never the edges. Each
> balloon contains some spit. She inflates my cheeks by blowing. It's
> hard to hug until it's over & over time her body becomes different
> from mine, warm breath unknown to nostrils. Chat rooms feel us, "how
> old r u." We tap on the two-way mirror. It was then that my body left
> me.

## g

> Trauma becomes so internalized that it loses words. Spilling your guts
> is such a mess. Nothing precious about a blowjob in the dark. My face
> is in the water, bobbing for apples. Incisors prick the skin and peel.
> Mamelons quickly wear away, revealing breast buds. It's about losing
> something that was never there to begin with. Why do I say incest
> instead of insect? Incest instead of incense? Bare ass landing on a
> glass frame. There is blood on Brett Favre's face. Now a big brother.
> The rock skips into my eye. That is one of the times I never wanted to
> come back up. The pool drains. Mina grabs a white towel, not quite
> knowing what to do with it. Her wedding dress was her sister's. The
> fabric fades into a mouthful of old cereal.

## h

> The pissed-on floral pattern blooms. Tan couch cushions and carpet
> darken with urine. I sit in the flooding gutter, jeans heavy, riding
> low. We wear underwear in the rain comparing blind spots. We are
> separated by lines. Wood becomes slippery, snaps, bone cracks. We
> don't always know why we're laughing. Watching Ronald Reagan's funeral
> with a broken arm. Nancy is preoccupied by stone steps in high heels.
> It's as if she's been here before. Nikki's dad is next to me on the
> plaid couch drinking beer. Deep swallows never seem to quench his
> thirst. We sign the fiberglass cast with metallic markers. The
> shopping bag is double knotted at the elbow, shower water still seeps
> in.

## i

> Spaghetti straps snap. The feeling of forever followed by tightness.
> Who can hold their breath longest? Staring contest. Bloody knuckles.
> Cigarettes singe flesh and so forth. Eyebrows are plucked into a thin
> line of stuck surprise. Longing to be concave, to convey some sort of
> desirable deprivation. Pouting sexpot. Nikki describes the euphoria of
> getting fingered while I pull long reeds out of the earth. Mina mows
> the lawn in grass-stained sneakers (Reeboks), circles of sweat
> permeate her pits. He pinches the puppy's pale nipple, wondering why
> milk doesn't come out. Now a big brother. The TV glows at different
> intensities, exposing nudes on the couch.

## j

> Sandbox laced with landscape fabric, sodden with subterraneous soil.
> China is straight down. Camp counselors survey the widening hole,
> weary of our enthusiasm, determination: dirt-packed nails. She sings
> *Meet Me With Your Black Dress On* while stoking the fire with scraps
> of paper, fiery ash extinguished by midnight blue. The only light we
> have is the red buzzing glow of an exit sign. Her lips on mine,
> inflating my cheeks into a quick, sighing balloon --- my pubic region
> warm & heaving --- laughter makes it somehow permissible. I have my
> first orgasm at b-ball practice. Free-throws ricochet off the rim,
> girls form a jostling blur beneath the hoop. Who has the ball?

## k

> Licking the gobstopper, its colors mix with blood. Can't taste a
> thing, but crave change. The blue comes back to yellow, with green
> in-between. Rawness is realer. Reduce the house to skeletal
> structures. Basement remains undone. Skin-on-skin, pressing into bone
> spur. I stare at the staircase, nails sticking out where carpet ought
> to be. Costumes deflate without the people inside. When do you let go?
> The balloon pops, tangled in the pines. Pearly white ribbon out of
> reach. Ice cream makes the car seat sticky. Eyes squint at seagulls
> flapping through hot air. How's the water so blue on you. Thighs
> chafe, stretch marks contour the ass cheek. Alyssa points, her finger
> stuck in the door.

## l

> Claustrophobic mouth space. Permanent bone-like pieces gather, words
> come out clunky. Thumbnail digs at the roots while we sit in a circle,
> the world beneath us in different colored threads. Lost count of the
> molars. Mina browses greeting cards and tugs at a helium balloon.
> Happy Birthday. A rotisserie chicken sits in the cart. Crescents
> unfold in the oven. At some point the cards become routine, leaving
> the words up to Hallmark and signing your name.

## m

> After brain surgery, Dorothy keeps hearing the same song over and
> over. The doctor tells her that that song was playing in the surgery
> room while she was unconscious and that it imprinted itself onto her
> brain. Dorothy asks if anything can be done, she doesn't particularly
> like this song.

## n

> He applies saliva to the tip of the Nerf dart and aims at the TV: WMD.
> Now a big brother. I press my face up to the screen and go through.
> Under blankets we see someone who's been dead the whole time. Mina
> lights a match to scare off the deer. She drives into the sun to and
> from work. Crow's feet are smile lines. The zen garden with a plastic
> rim, sand in the keyboard. Wouldn't it be easier to forget? Which is
> to say, why don't you? The paper slips on my pointer finger. It's too
> easy to say "shit".

## o

> I fall in love. Mina says it's witchcraft the way I light candles --
> wax dripping into carpet, a hardened maroon. I'm not casting spells
> but staring straight into flames, love is blind. Maimed. The whites of
> his pimples, I would pop them. Smiley face smiley face. Fill in the
> silence with I don't know what. Wear his jeans but they are too tight.
> Longing to be concave, a cave. I don't know what. Greasy blonde hair
> tucked behind shiny ears. Dust bunny belly lint. I'm never full, never
> enough fingers, only fists. Chew on split ends, on drawstrings. Suck
> on your thumb, bite my arm. Forearm hickey. Crooked teeth marks look
> like staples, keeping it all together.

## p

> Puddles, pools. It's the time of year when dirt turns to mud. Knee
> high in it out in the corn field, trying to get stuck. Shoes and socks
> get lost in the stalks. Faded blue jeans coated in crackling mud.
> Encrusted skin, granules cling to the tiny hairs on my arms and
> midriff. Shave the happy trail to lose direction, throw off the scent.
> There is only up and down and I haven't found the bottom. The sun dips
> behind trees and appendages go numb. Clothes are wet and heavy,
> dragging as they harden. Solidifying into a sculpture, cracking out of
> marble. Losing my marbles. Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss. Eros in a
> corn maze, shucking. By sundown I am stuck in one place, returned to
> form.
