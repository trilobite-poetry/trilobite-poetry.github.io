## WHACK A MOLE OF THE MIND

Writing a song for myself   
Crying and I'm thinking---   
I don't know why I do it   

---

The light outside looked good today   
When it shined off   
The smooth objects in the yard---    
There's a metal ball in the pond   
There's an orange ceramic frog   
And there's his counterpart   
The California Raisin   

---

("Are they a set?" Meg asked about the   
CA Raisin and frog   
"No ... but a pair," I told her)   

---

I'm thinking---    
The light outside definitely looked good today from   
The kitchen window   
And it definitely looked good when I walked right into it   
From out the kitchen door   
Later, too   

---

When I looked at the light shining off   
The smooth objects I didn't think   
Of other scenarios in which I might   
Better enjoy the light   

---

I just enjoyed the light, and I guess I enjoyed   
The not comparing   
Or   
Maybe I enjoyed comparing it   
To the times I did   
Compare before   

---

In my neighborhood there's a Kadampa meditation center   
Cause of the pandemic I've never gone in   
But I go hang outside on the stone bench   
Facing the stone Buddha   

---

A few weeks ago I started   
Meditating after my friend   
Lent me a book   

---

So I sat on the stone bench   
Faced the Buddha   
Had the song in my pocket on my phone   
Robin Williams singing the sea shanty   
From the smacked Harry Nilsson *Popeye* soundtrack   

---

Non-attachment   
Is not real   

---

Not expecting   
Is not real   

---

Not hoping   
Is not real   

---

But we can be less rigid   
I need to be less rigid   

---

The whack a mole   
Of the mind   

---

Every so often   
An idea pops in or out   

---

The mole in whack a mole retreats   
Whether they're clubbed away or not   

---

And the whack a mole comes back up   
Fresh every time   

---

God my life   
I lay down on the bench   
And I didn't care while the tiny piece of cigarette I had fell   
Onto the ground   

---

Writing a song   
I'm writing a song for myself and   
I'm crying every time   

---

I remember how I felt before   
I wanna be unknowing like the mole   
Like the mole, emerged from the underworld   
With the dandelion stem   
Around their neck   
Sojourner of darkness and life and death   
Again   

## THE DAYS OF CICADAS

The days of cicadas are loud   
And the nights of the cicadas are quiet   
I don't listen to how the droning calls of the cicadas   
Harmonize with the Tone Poets tape   
I heard about from Colin   
And downloaded from the free archive   
Site   

---

I don't measure time by   
When the cicada sounds start to die down   
In the evergreens out past my window   

---

I measure my time by how long it's been since we last talked   
How many tears are in my eyes   
How many times each day I need to lie down   

## NOW

Two butterflies together   
One: big yellow   
Two: small white   
Yeah   
Two butterflies   
By the purple flowers   
Whose names I don't remember   
Whose leaves look like weed   
And stems   
Frilly   

---

It is a day   
I feel totally dry   
Yeah totally   

---

There is no time   
Like the present that's   
Why they call it   
Now
