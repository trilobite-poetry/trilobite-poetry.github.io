## The woman says

I have an encrypted pregnancy:

---

The fetus

---

is dispersed through my organs,

---

throughout all the parts of my body.

---

When the Lord

---

sounds the trumpet,

---

the fetus will reassemble itself

---

and I will give birth to the Messiah.


## shroud

She wheezes through loose soil and---

because souls are diaphanous---she sings falsetto.

---

Though pale, palest, she is

livid against the pallor of the given world.

---

The number eleven is arbitrary, nonetheless

"resurrection" must appear in the middle line

---

of the poem. High,

higher, until all the dogs in creation

---

shudder at the pitch of it,

her loose weave, her gauzy tune. She bends her hips, stands

---

her up, chalky soil draped around the white blush of her ankles,

and so transparent the song that levitates beyond the range of

---

human perception.


## pilgrimage

Epiphany jilts revelation: lover tracks the

movements of ex-lover, blotched footprints pressed in dirt.

---

This holey vessel. This. This. This

---

in a sequence, no, a clot, no, a knotted cluster of veins

that claimed itself as a body.

---

An aphrodisiac that stirs the no-body.

---

Adoration that scorns fulfillment as excess.

---

To renege on delirium, erotic error

---

wandering without shoes, then without feet.

---

Plasma

---

bending from forgotten arteries or

through them.

---

Orgiastic sequence diffused in a cloud of pronouns.
