Hello character, b

3 point 9 - 6... 9 - 8.

---

How will you say the lines?

"I am a magic bird!"

Therefore all the lemons.

---

Mouth in the position

of yes. The eyebrows up.

---

What is the matter in

1 these days? Keeping track

of the little dog's needs.

---

Not so inspiring

being bitten or pulled

---

through the streets. I can say that

Magic bird is patient

That magic is patience.

---

Feelings yes, yes, of course

Real fast. "I am letting

---

Go." Why can't you let go?

Why can't you let yourself

go. It's near here. The rain

---

the beautiful filter.

Saturation stations

---

I can't eat your beauty

I'm not that kind of guy,

I'm talked out of being

---

so. I've talked to myself.

Outloud, everyday, "hi."
