## Thank You For These Cockroach Memories   

On 10/12/2023 I got my orchiectomy   
In the clear mid-day of New Hampshire   
Where you can look out the window of the hospital   
And see that the ghost pepper Whopper is back   
I turned 37 at some point during this procedure,   
I don’t know when, Abby was out there gazing   
At the ghost pepper Whopper and foreseeing,   
I like to think, the next week’s rains,   
And knitting something specific, green and brown,   
A metrical thing perpendicular to me there, snoozing,   
And out of the slit open body, surprise! Cockroaches,   
In this half-meandering dream, capering out in joy   
“Congratulations a lot on getting your balls cut off,   
Even though dogs get this all the time for free,   
Actually they don’t even need to work that hard for it,   
It’s just the price of playing the game,   
For boy dogs of a particular rakish character…”   
“Am I better at being trans now,” I ask the dancing roaches,   
Who say “that’s a pathetic and needy question”   
I say “ok” and they disperse in all directions   
The doctors say “cut that out” and I blubber   
Unconvincingly, it’s not like I’m   
The roaches’ boss

I am writing this down to make a note of what it’s like   
To cast some minor flesh aside, say hey no you keep this   
To the anesthesiologists and nurses like dispensing a tip,   
Did you know about Vejovis, the evil mode of Jupiter,   
Who was the god of healing and kept his lightning   
In his tight mitts, who nicknamed himself Summanus   
And got his head knocked off by storms   
And whose head was never found again,   
Not dredged from the bottom of the Tiber River   
Nor seen in thick sleep by the bolt-happy haruspices   
Whose fingers smelled foul and leaked black juice down the hill   
No   
Down the same pit in which he tipped the rotten goats and wethers   
Went his heavy head, down and down,   
Lightning on the high hill, lightning after lightning after lightning,   
The regular army of bugs at the foot of the peak   
Working their miracle mouths   
Making found things vanish   
In the far future I am meeting the cockroach president   
At waste disposal pit #17, a quiet but buzzy slime pit   
Where the most deliriously mutated movers and shakers   
Slurp what some critics call the most food-like   
Protein slurry in town   
I ask if he remembers me, his own mother,   
Or something, does he remember spilling out   
From New Hampshire and skedaddling,   
Gone forever, and now, look, how he’s made   
Something of himself, where’s the gratitude?   
“I don’t care,” says cockroach president,   
Spinning a gun around each billion-fold finger,   
And telling me how he’s been dating a highwayman,   
A real road agent, you know what I mean   
Though I have no more money than a capuchin   
I horde the dignity of the hollows like a coin   
Pouched to the side of the cheek, a lucky acorn   
Or magic dice hidden through ordeals   
Which cockroach president can really get onboard with   
And I eat my protein slurry with a smile   
And the slurry fucken sucks (tastes like slurry)

On 10/22/2023 Abby comes back from New York   
With a leftover biscuit and some gravy, for me,   
And I’m embarrassed to admit I’ve been forgetting to eat   
Since sleeping on the day-bed, out of it from pain and unable   
To skip nimbly into the regular bed, poor honey, she says,   
When the brocken bows project the ghost of a testicle   
High against grey Mount Mansfield, singular and wobbling,   
And every cockroach cultist throngs to wave its   
Tiny lighter in the air in adoration, it’s fine,   
I’m honestly flattered, all of these pinpricks of green light   
Rippling like sheathes beyond where I can see them

Thank you for these cockroach memories,   
I wish I could say, like doctors fond of the visceral   
Thrill sometimes hold the cyst to your face, like the world’s   
Worst strawberry, as if waiting for you to kiss it goodbye   
I am the guy in Asalto la Coche, not the guy with the gun   
And not the guy lying dead, no, the guy jumbled up   
Three legs and four arms on the ground, a huge   
Syzygy of accidents and ill-chosen practices   
Ignored by the polite bandits looking with their thumbs   
In their mouths at the pleading toffs, the pile of heads   
That drifted downstream from elsewhere, all of them   
Making their separate apologies…   
And if the stitches dissolve and the adhesive melts   
And the cockroaches return from their tour   
With new tattoos and intimidating facial hair,   
Interesting looking knives flicking up and down   
In their novel rascal hands,   
I’d batten the gates against them   

## Maul is Lost Episode I: I Am Darth Maul

In 1999 my body was chopped   
In half by a guy named Obi-Wan Kenobi   
And this was not the end, no,   
But a sort of pale middle, a nuisance   
That disrupted my days for awhile   
Then abated, like a pet with bad teeth,   
Or an uninsured cyst   

---

I fell down a garbage pit, or something,   
For what must have been years, in that time   
Thinking mostly about my student loans,   
Whether or not, as a cut in half person,   
I would still have to pay them.   
I fell forever. You don’t need to worry about it.   

---

I fell down a garbage pit and saw with splendor   
My bottom half spinning away into obscurity,   
And did not know what was to come.   
In space we make very little money   
And our bosses are bad.   
I am in debt not from schooling,   
But from being kept in an evil wizard’s closet   
For so long, learning only how to cartwheel   
And cleave everything in two for no reason.   
In a garbage pit I saw lights turn on   
And then off again in unprecedented patterns,   
Windows rushing past me, the planet   
disclosed coyly in the innards   
Of its inexplicable central tubes and power cores and   
I imagined a different life in which I might have gasped   
To see some sort of alive-type creature   
Reveal itself in kind to me in animal joy, beautiful,   
Rapid, this seduction of the garbage pit in vertical terminus.   
I could have kissed Obi-Wan Kenobi   
For spinning and flipping with me, for a little bit,   
And when I fell swiftly from him with a cool   
Little kick I felt a lowness in my heart,   
As with stitches being removed,   
A brief nausea, little pops and starbursts   
Before my yellow eyes, that “were we not friends?” sensation   
You know, like from middle school or fainting   
From catastrophic blood loss   

---

When I came at last to the gate of heaven   
I found no saints waiting, but the mortis god himself,   
Personally, a move I thought spoke to   
A kind of cheapness to the whole affair   

---

He asked if I still smoked and I said no,   
He said my tattoos and sharp teeth looked cool.   
I said thank you.   

---

At this point in the poem I am trying out alternate   
Ways this all could have gone, in my mind I am biting   
Obi-Wan Kenobi’s lower lip, like in all of my fan-fictions,   
And he is becoming alarmingly more beautiful   
In between each frame and falling backwards   
Out of view, forever,   
I am rotating the world with my own volition,   
In make believe, I am conceiving of an impermanence   
Of angle and approach.   
God noted with an air   
Of polite awe that I was too mean to die.   
A mean bastard like you should get to live forever…   
No, no. I said.   
I’m actually nice   
And very very sweet   

## Maul Is Lost Episode II: You Are Darth Maul

And you are asking me if I like you   
As much as I did when I was 12   
And saw your body splayed in two across the screen   
Like a rubik’s cube appealingly smashed in half,   
Like,   
“Riddle solved!”   
And I bite off the front ⅕ of my tongue   
To avoid hurting your feelings, better   
To head off speech entirely   
Than say an unkind word to a man clearly suffering,   
Your legs replaced with vast metal spider’s legs,   
Your face all soured and wretched,   
Huge viscous golden tears clumped at the corners   
Of your nasty looking eyes   
Are you flirting with me? Is your metal spider leg touching   
My thigh to be cute, or out of an evil robot hunger?   
I shift politely half a foot to the side.   

---

I feel as if you’d tricked me   
Into thinking the divorce of the body from itself   
Would be as easy as picking the wrong fight,   
Or tiring myself out pacing in a lean and   
Mangy way between the right set of forcefields,   
The parts I hated spiraling out of sight in bloodless   
Parallax, the parts I favored augmented by witches   
You became so furious in the famous golden light of TV   
That you sutured back together   
Whatever famous golden white ninjas had stolen   
If I seem upset with you that’s why   
I stop playing with your pinky finger,   
I stop rotating your chunky pinky rings around   
I break eye contact   
I throw your dangerous sword into the ocean   

---

The hairdresser asked if I wanted to look like you   
I said bald head no   
Myriad horns yes   
And she made a sound like, “tph,” or “chhh”   
She began the incision just above the ear   
And kept carving until I apologized   
For the unseemly weight and wan color   
Of the messed up brain she held dripping   
Over the sink   
As a child I thought your tongue would be black,   
Like a goat’s, and that your teeth would taste   
The same as the end of a battery tastes   
How naive, how adorable, blundering around outside,   
Not knowing that a goat’s tongue is just as pink as mine   

## Maul is Lost Episode III: I Am Me, and Darth Maul is Hidden, Crouched Behind the Wawa in the Last Stanza

The fingers are worse at being eyes than the eyes are, and the
teeth are bad at being fingers. I’m told over and over again to
stop studying the back of my head with my hands, so nervous of
anomalies, little bumps or errors in the fabric of skull and
hair. When I wake up I worry that I taste blood, but no, it’s
just coffee, and I’m bad at tasting with a finger hooked into the
cheek. Or is it blood actually actually…? The nice doctor who’s
probably younger than me is getting tired of being asked if I
have cancer of the piss so I make a little joke to him. We both
laugh for 27 minutes, the world clapping and hooting and losing
its mind just outside the window, in nine inches of snow, curled
beneath the cars and trembling.

I think I dreamt there was a secret third kind of bile that blew
the lid wide open on humoural theory, not one too fine to merit
the doctors’ notice, but one too gross to be acknowledged,
luminous, a huge fake green like a childrens’ game show from the
90s. And when it rises from the human body it rises in tricky
malice, out of the mouth and nose like the teleplasmic hand,
cheesecloth and phosphorus, and everybody prays for it to go back
inside. The third kind of bile makes you stupid, it seeps, it
communicates clamorously via telepathy about this sort of minutia
and that, and I drink it in giant mouthfuls from my favorite
little cup with an H on it.

Everyone I went to highschool with has since ascended to the
state of culture hero, or has died into formal saintliness. Some
of them hover in a circle outside, humming gently, others leap
from the tops of skyscrapers and land unharmed. Some are writing
short novels about other countries. Some are holding their
flagons to the light and going “haw!” I have gained only a girl’s
name and healthy rations of the third kind of bile, and a medical
body, and free time. I am licking the third kind of bile from my
fingers like a cartoon bear, third kind of bile sticky on my face
in green, splattered in gobs on all my nice sweaters. My doctor
is shaking his head at the inevitability. The pills against
baldness and stupidity might be fake. The guns against stupidity
and acedia might be unloaded. They might be loaded with squibs. I
aim wildly into the sky just to check. In this era of polite
honesty I root myself in the garden as if I were a sweet potato,
immerse myself with ESP in the transit of snakes and bugs. I only
read Star Wars novels and I do not play videogames with any kind
of point to them. I have not had an idea since 2019. When I am
done with the crops outside, I gather other, faker crops on the
computer. I examine the dog’s brown teeth. I go “haw!” and
remember with great pleasure the name of each kind of lightsaber
fighting style (matashi, ataru, the dreaded vapad…). I am
teaching children how to spell “invert” online. I am looking up
pictures of naked gay people from 1908, for school, and
remembering that all of them are dead.
{: .prose-block }

The hairdresser asks if I want to look like an ewok and my
silence is damning. She asks if I want to look like a girl ewok
and I begin to sweat a third kind of bile from my forehead and
cheeks, bioluminescent and joyful. When I was a baby I was saved
from untimely and gruesome death by an esoteric god of honest
answers, now dead, and I pay down that debt permanently whenever
I spit out the gristle of the day. I am trying to consolidate all
known loans by shaking the rustic spear of a girl ewok at the
computer and snarling, I am on my hands and knees in Burlington,
Vermont crawling inch by inch south towards the Wawas of my
smooth-skinned youth, backlit by the sun and prosperous,
desperate to crawl back into that pupa-hole, someone awful
waiting by the milk crates and the day old bread.

## Maul is Lost Episode IX: We Are Qui-Gon Jin

The dead speak!   
We are a lot of young children with loose teeth,   
And old men becoming older with loose teeth   

---

We’re chewed up cookie between the tooth and the gum,   
Shaking, we are the possibility of a tiny fracture running   
From the root to the fine air   

---

Look--- we are dead.   
You will be polite at our funeral   
Comb the pollen from our stupid hair-cut   
Remember us as we were, doing backflips   
From the breezeway   

---

We did not come here to free the slaves   
Or solve any problems   
Or return your mother to you forever   
We came here to look into the middle distance   
At something emerging from the dust a cool   
And interesting shape   
As immaculate as we are   
Our hand on our own joint beard   
Our nasty little swords totally invisible   
And inconceivable to the untaught eye   

---

We are going to the ocean in a mysterious shape   
And not returning   
Oh look at us dwindling   
Oh commodities with living eyeballs   
We will own our own home   
We are over dozens, over thousands, over billions   
Of stupid molecules dancing in a vial   
And explaining fungibility to spirits   
We will become the ghost   
As a method of professional development   
We will never own our own home   
Or own it with resentment   
And eat feral crumbs for supper two nights in a row   

---

We will turn your sand to sand inside your mouth   
You will sink beneath the red waves   
While we’re looking at something else   
In the totally opposite direction   
Growing larger and more fascinating   
And somehow from some neglected space returning
