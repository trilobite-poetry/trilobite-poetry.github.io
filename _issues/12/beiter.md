## At the filling station at Palmyra

there are no more white horses among the red-brick   
walls, and no one is going to Nashville---   
not that anyone could get there, with the dead   
weather that tore down the porticoes   
and left one column in the desert   
still sitting, so the set in the corner   
only gets rabbit television for the young man   
working at the counter. The magazine rack   
just has one title, *Defied Augury*, which   
the whisper of scratched inscriptions says   
is what the station itself did when we built   
on the remains of an upstairs circus.   
You can almost feel the chariots beneath your feet.   

## Via Dolorosa

At the top (which I never reach)   
of the great glass open tower   
I meet the three: the dragon:   
long onyx-scaled builder, eyes fixed and yellow,   
who makes the rain fall through the place the roof   

---

should be; the princess, her fading, scale-touched,   
kingdom---all cobblestones and blue-robed acolytes   
in rain praying over endless streets---appearing   
in the drops which hit like lights upon   
the stair that lengthens as I climb   
(clear stone, a cold that isn't cold and never   

---

melts); the Infant of Prague,   
fading jewels and thin velvet   
glimmering the safety of his sister's subjects.   
They tell what is found   
in this barren place: glass, dust, water.   
I keep climbing. The rain keeps on.   

## Drowned Phoenix: Fragments of a Ritual Doctrine Found on Potsherds Dredged from the Silt of the Susquehanna

The coming of the god was like drowning, but beautiful.

---

You can hardly see the mountains   
through the water's screen; the   
river in the road where god has come   

to melt into the winds   
like me flying, more than made of flesh   
but bursting out of it.   

---

It has come to wash us, to make color rebegin, to leach, to whip, to
cold. I dance like to fly and break and bleed, no body being all of no
body and the sky filling the lungs and the dissolution of cold. The
water flying up like wings and ink to wash everything away. The deep
water, the wait, my blood, the smearing and the color. Black was blues
and reds and the world becoming over again. We become when we enter the
rain.

Break---eyes shatter   
into the darkness and glass   
\[. . .\]   

---

the light   
emerging as through cracks   
in a stone cover.   

---

Flood me. Flood me up to the edge of the world and take me into the sea
\[. . .\] the knowledge that nothing survives change without changing.
The bleeding ink, the chrysalis, the wind over skin until there was no
skin, only wind.

Dance   
\[. . .\]

I am the wind's handmaiden. All air the voice of god: "You are my
servant, and I task you as you have always been meant to be tasked, with
the drenching."
{: .prose-block }

Return in the drowned   
face. I surface, but   
slowly breaking   

---

in the rain and made   
of the same as what this god   
is made   

---

the dance and the patter   
of the rain and the colorless   
and the giving of vision.   

---

I bless what has been   
taken. There is nothing   
that cannot be borne.   

---

The power and the flash brought to life as everything wanted the dance.
There is nothing that cannot be revived.
{: .prose-block }

I am needed: I cannot   
refuse. Let   
me be yours, let me   

---

drink and feel the touch that   
burns and cools and   
know each breath I am less.   

---

//

---

This shall be as beautiful as the horse we rode in on. The blue. White
water, black ink; there is no opening unopened and the fixity has gone
to be replaced. What spring is more than none and the door-place and the
claw: the desire and the dance in the excess.
{: .prose-block }

there is no whelm   
and fragment or the one who   
breaks. Like eyes,   

---

light   
leaking out, power   
overwhelmed.   

---

Please your obliteration of what I once was and that made me to return
to the wind, to the cold more alive than the body. More than any body,
the water and the frigid air---this when it knows to take the sky black
and every color at once and beautiful and insurmountable. Become nothing
but the glorious dance and the pyre and the heat and the light without
heat; pure becoming without being, pure sound without sense and vice
versa.
{: .prose-block }

I am only the hollow   
where there was lightning   
and the god-voice that   

---

came down to touch you   
---the sound and the shape,   
the world never the same.   

---

//

---

The order covers the world and breaks like the light there is drowning.
Observe it the same as that which knows to relinquish. To flee, to fill,
to abandon, to drown. The god knows what is taken and only for a moment
before it continues only by the letting to relinquish.
{: .prose-block }

The calm is the same   
as the storm it replaces   
when the storm can hold on   

---

no longer.   
The calm is desire and the fury   
fulfillment.   

---

The drowning will never   
discolor the body;   
it always discolors   

---

it. The brilliancy   
is brighter for the   
blanching. The god   

---

walked where there was   
no land and the sun   
broke behind the man   

---

there once was.   
The drowning can never   
dissolve its discolors.   

---

We can see the washing of the world. I feel the dance on my deep blood
and the slow soak is the sound of his furious wild peace that blesses
with its touch.

The dying of the god is needed. The dying of the body precedes it. The
dying of the dying is what gives itself a name and there is nothing
after it but that which came before.

To be a prophet is painful, but this god has need only of oracles. Can
you hear it still in the sun and the stillness? The dance in your blood
for the god? Learn to enter and refuse it into being. Learn to cease, to
begin---as being utterly motionless.
{: .prose-block }

Break like the light   
from the eyes, like crashing   
the edge, like water moving.   

---

Give over and there shall be motion enough without you and nothing left
in your body but the wind. The wind knows best when it knows nothing,
and you went to serve in nothing. You shall be the mouthpiece of the
trumpet played by god. To drown, to drink, to bathe, to fail to say what
is meant, to bleed out.
{: .prose-block }

The sun and the water   
mark themselves over   
as the same sign.   

---

The tree and the bush a second,   
contradictory one.   
Perhaps it is poison   

---

that shall be learned.   
Hear it whispering still,   
the eye breaking.   

---

The sun is learning to walk all over again, uncertain what is being
said. I hear the god whispering that I am its and the world is vapors.

This message shall be taken down exactly as it has been spoken, exactly
as the back crawls and the fervor sits on being when there is nothing to
return the pouring. In smudge and blood there waits the feeling of god's
kiss, which will be weaker than its touch. Nothing is permitted to end
until the end has truly been recorded. I have had it asked of me, and I
intend to honor what I have promised to the thing that comes, becoming
here, long-limbed and icy and utterly, utterly, formless.
{: .prose-block }

the world \[. . .\]   
relearning its color, being   
a becoming   

---

and washed   
like a broken glass.   
The cold transformation, great.   

---

The drowned phoenix has become, has spoken, has learned what it must be,
and I a vessel to it. Have you heard the voice of god? Can you bring me
the sun in its fading? And the river-and-sea in winged ascendance? I
shall reflect them, revoice them, relive them, refound them if I shall
be permitted to dance the dance that has been taught and allowed to be
the conduit of the resurrection of resurrection, the one who both is,
and is the enemy of, the end, who shall undo doing and yet change. The
one who will become, who will be able to be nothing while being
everything.
{: .prose-block }

The rabbit, come to devour   
the moon. The specter rising   
up and you know not what   

---

it means. You know who   
has sent it. The departure of   
the god, already relinquished.   

---

There is no more lasting when the rain has gone, no more coming unto
itself. We have become and will proceed, in transformed becoming, the
continuation of the end of earth and body and end. The end which
includes not just that of ends and endings but also beginnings. The wait
is endless but at the end what rewards have been promised to those who
let themselves dance, fill, fracture, who know what the sound that
cannot be made might be saying. The final return and the fear of what
had been left in the first place.
{: .prose-block }

Know this in the wings of drowned phoenix: the end has not come; you
have not yet become only vessel again.
