## JUST NOW THE ROSES

My roses prick'd and pruning
{: .doublespace }

shears nudge apart their lacy
{: .doublespace }

leaves, devoured by the irrisible
{: .doublespace }

worm I seek out, poetically, blind
{: .doublespace }

to s/mother of white death. Devouring
{: .doublespace }

whiteness blanching husks hollowèd, raiments
{: .doublespace }

snowy where before color was, life. Greening
{: .doublespace }

sickly, turnt paperie. Budding tongues cut off
{: .doublespace }

by relentless white appetite, aphid breath, death's kiss,
{: .doublespace }

little vampires, slavering for color, consumptive; etiolate.
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

*They can die, I need feed them nothing,*
{: .doublespace }

*I am the owner*, quoth Plath, a fury in her bee-bonnet.
{: .doublespace }

Surely roses' little lives are worth
{: .doublespace }

less, but: surveilling the scene, I tether their
{: .doublespace }

blight, my white eyes witness to
{: .doublespace }

the destruction whiteness wrought
{: .doublespace }

and works on their vulnerabilities,
{: .doublespace }

their audacious color, the heady
{: .doublespace }

scent that is there vital, being
{: .doublespace }

roses, deeply pink and luxuriant.
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

I cannot bee a rose, but I can
{: .doublespace }

attend them, channel energies
{: .doublespace }

to keeping them alive, extirpate
{: .doublespace }

the parade of little white hoods
{: .doublespace }

marching to spoliate and destroy, themselves
{: .doublespace }

mirrored in my clumsy hands pulling
{: .doublespace }

sticky snow from their stems, their leaves
{: .doublespace }

felling a healthy branch in the too-bigness
{: .doublespace }

of my bumbling body. Ladybugs
{: .doublespace }

police viciously but introduce
{: .doublespace }

a new hierarchy of needs, interrupted
{: .doublespace }

in cultivation, my intrusions. My god
{: .doublespace }

-head bring forth life to des-
{: .doublespace }

troy it.

{: .doublespace }

Do aphid lives matter to
{: .doublespace }

anyone? Capital cuteness
{: .doublespace }

for Rose & Ladybuggers
{: .doublespace }

rosaceae all the coccinellidae
{: .doublespace }

adorably eaten out (blushing)
{: .doublespace }

and devouring, respectively
{: .doublespace }

fleecy aphid-o-idea snapped
{: .doublespace }

between fingers. I pull on lacy
{: .doublespace }

garters and garden the lacewings
{: .doublespace }

glue-gunning her pearls her bulbs her eggs
{: .doublespace }

to stem voracious predatory appetites
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

So easy to fool, to foil for
{: .doublespace }

a lady cloaked invisible, versed in deceit
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

dropless veils, topless illusion
{: .doublespace }

which egg under the cup? Answer:
{: .doublespace }

dangling on a silken thread
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

cradled assassins
{: .doublespace }

swaddled in silk
{: .doublespace }

beat their wings in
{: .doublespace }

rose protectorate
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

fruitlessly: a dear came by and ate their heads off
{: .doublespace }

it's always the ones who love you
{: .doublespace }

most acephalous rose, find a way to get a head
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

girls are not roses, though they be likenedlie
{: .doublespace }

saturating the air pink with their odor
{: .doublespace }

rose girls bloom furiously
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

cultivated or wild: that spectator be pleasured
{: .doublespace }

upon their site; that roses peerlessly virtue-guard
{: .doublespace }

(every rose has its dogtooth day, lest they asketh for it)
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

that rose-bloom temporary and discarded be
{: .doublespace }

off with their heads, dripping red
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

(we dare not stop or waist a drop, so let their names be spread)
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

For Pinar Gültekin whose name is trapped in the lantern of her body
{: .doublespace }

plunged in oil
{: .ts2 .doublespace }

For Alejandra Negrete whose name dangles off her platform sandal's
{: .doublespace }

bony anklet
{: .ts2 .doublespace }

For Queasha Hardy whose name cannot be snipped away, clear as fault on
{: .doublespace }

the asphalt
{: .ts2 .doublespace }

For Breonna Taylor whose name cannot be knocked, riddled with bullets
{: .doublespace }

behind a locked door, the cries of which rise like gunsmoke
{: .ts2 .doublespace }

For Mahsa Amini, whose name we hoist amidst our severed schoolgirl hair

dead naming the dead girls dead

we're watching the roses red

we're wrathing the roses dead

†
{: .doublespace }

{: .doublespace }

I am too late: the roses wither, shaded bodies rapt
{: .doublespace }

in faded newsprint, plucked untimely from the earth
{: .doublespace }

then cast back to nurture our rot
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

countless mutilate roses rouged with shit
{: .doublespace }

and frozen in our glass boxes
{: .doublespace }

seen onscreen, they wilt in real time
{: .doublespace }

we watch their decline contemptuously
{: .doublespace }

we signal virtues from heaven's wards: chewing prejaundice
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

we yellow in gloat till we drowse in fat, reverie
{: .doublespace }

coddled to lullaby. Prick a finger, Aurora---
{: .doublespace }

bid us wake to a better end
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

The animal kingdom is the city that never
{: .doublespace }

sleeps. The vegetal king wears his flower crown
{: .doublespace }

and weaves a bower for all the dead girls
{: .doublespace }

---
{: .doublespace }

their blue lips honeyed with gloss
{: .doublespace }

their beds stained crimson red
{: .doublespace }

their eyes bruising to open a fisted whorled
{: .doublespace }

their hearts arrested on the beat
{: .doublespace }

their beautiful poetical deaths rhapsodizing us to seed our garish
dreams
{: .doublespace }

{: .doublespace }

washed in dirt, affixed to earth

## DON'T DO IT (DON'T DO IT)

I'm in another life and I\'m walking in a museum and I come
upon *The Rose*,
and I see someone looking at it, and I walk up to them and nudge them
and
say, 'I did that.'

## FLORIOGRAPHY

5,000 years of roses: from ancient China, Sumeria; later Assyria, Japan,
Persia (so popular therein that *gül*, the word for *rose,* designates
*flower*)
{: .prose-block .doublespace }

Observing the flower language by which polite Turkish culture tacitly
communicated, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu wrote a series of letters home
to England detailing the practice: "There is no colour, no flower, no
weed, no fruit, herb, pebble, or feather that has not a verse belonging
to it: and you may quarrel, reproach, or send letters of passion,
friendship, or civility, or even of news, without ever inking your
fingers." Her letters, collectively published in 1763, sparked the trend
of *langages des fleurs* in western Europe. Unfortunately, this Montagu
too fell prey to the name trap, mistranslating the christening of these
rosy Turkish delights and overwriting a visual language that connected
words and objects via homophonic associations and rhyme with a projected
sentimentality.
{: .prose-block .doublespace }

The 1839 English translation of Charlotte de Latour's French *Langage
des Fleurs* offers similarly aural coding for sending messages via
flowers: "daisy, (or day's eye) imports pure virginity. . . as being
itself the virgin bloom of the year." Opening with short vignettes,
arranged seasonally, for flowers and the emotions they symbolize, the
book resorts to matching lists and an alphabetized gloss; the rose is
afforded a 12-page spread with a full-color illustration depicting her
majesty, her modesty. de Latour speculates that roses' thorns are the
result of cultivation, positing that roses allowed to grow wild would
not need these thorny reminders of human hubris.
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;display:inline;">Meta-floriography</span>:
flowers can not only be used by humans
to express their codes but can also communicate *themselves* to us,
e.g.,
{: .prose-block .doublespace }

the roses: *Bite me*
{: .prose-block .doublespace }

Thorny!
{: .prose-block .doublespace }

Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, *Hello, the Roses*: "Then experience is
revelation ... when\] I inhale the perfume of the Bourbon rose, then try
to separate what is scent, sense, and what you call memory, what is
emotion, where in a dialogue like touching is so vibratory and so
absorbent of my attention and longing, with impressions like
fingerprints all over."

"I'm saying physical perception is the data of my embodiment, whereas
for the rose, scarlet itself is matter."
{: .prose-block .doublespace }

In 1867 the rose mattered as a hybrid tea-rose: the modern rose, advent
of
a thoroughly modern progeny that reset the rose game (the mater rose
from Chinese 'tea' roses and hybrid perpetual rose workhorses, midwifed
by rosarian Jean-Baptiste André Guillot and christened *La France.*)
Roses grew wild and native the world over, of course; but preying, the
rosarians cultivated the hardy and multifoliate roses we know today. In
cultivation, hardiness and petal volume self-select over odor; our
chilling buckets of thornless stems are preserved in our refrigerators
to hardly smell. How to breed odor back in?

Ronald Reagan signs a proclamation November 7, 1986, declaring rose the
national flower of the United States of America (the runner-up: native
and homely, home-grown and hardy, stinky marigolds---a sham
competition). The handsome and finicky Ronald Reagan rose a deep red
with white reverse (white trickles-down economically); Nancy Reagan rose
is peachy, an old-fashioned apricot with hunter green foliage. Both
hybrid tea-party pedigree, hardy as roses can be (hardly). Still we are
beguiled by their beauty:

As a babe, the face of Isabel Flores de Oliva (Saint Rose of Lima)
turned into a rose; as she prayed the crown of roses, devout and
virginal in her silver crown spiked with thorns, she underslept so as to
afford more time to prayer; upon her death, the city rained roses and
passed her skull bedecked with a rose-crown while her torso installed in
the sanctuary. Beatified by Pope Clement IX in the 17th century, Rosa de
Lima was the first saint of the Americas, demoted to second-class
patronage in 1942 by Pope Pius XII. As in her life, the \[men of her\]
world could not approbate her fervent piety and so sidelined her in a
grotto of severely self-inflicted penance and ecstatic devotion. In
death, her city smelled divinely of roses.

Roses produce scent via monoterpenes, acyclic (linear, line-based chain
compound) alcohols that manifest as geraniol, the terpene in rose oil
that provides the rose with its heady scent. Like many other
monoterpenes, geraniol (rose-scent) is an allelochemical, a genetic
trait of the plant that exists to actively inhibit the grow of its
neighboring plant. In a recent study, *Hypericum perforatum* (St. John's
Wort) and *Phleum pratense*, an important European forage grass, were
exposed to the geraniol chemotype; none of the H. perforatum seeds
germinated, and P. pratense seed germination was strongly inhibited.
Rose effectively castrated her neighbor plants. Would she smell as sweet
if called geraniol? With her allelochemically phytotoxic gate-keeping,
Rose removes herself---sets herself apart---from the garden, gelding any
who dare encroach her ladyship. Ice queen, inbred and stinking of
geraniol, made wholly through self-selected isolation.
