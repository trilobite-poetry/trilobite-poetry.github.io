cascading on sound

---

while stillness *persists*

---

hovering
{: .ts4 }

---

being stretched
{: .ts8 }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />

on tent poles

---

*butters a roof*

---

arched by a tongue

stacking surroundings into a rubik's cube

---

an enclosed sense of light

as inward perspective

---

[worn out waves intertwine into a *string*]

---

{: .newpoem }

rippled steps cracked a watermelon rind

along the *stripes* of shadows

---

egg whites whip up a space

into unsubstantial meringues nourishing

in the oven of listening

---

[ear-th-quake]

---

surfaces glued with viscous *elastic* rain

become elevators

---

tiers of hummocks *activate*

a tremor mechanism

<hr style="margin: 2rem 0;" />

5.25.25

---
{: .newpoem }

a pecked membrane

set entry points *ajar*

---

tickling turnstiles

rotating tissues

stained with unleashed thoughts

---

orange sections

cast rails to carry

discursive cargos

on a held breath

---

capsulated by temporality

as blister packs of yolks

---

to have become appropriated

by substance's chart

attempting to retain consistency

as time disperses

---

*incrusting*

<hr style="margin: 2rem 0;" />

---
{: .newpoem }

a crocheted chirping

being pulled with side-to-side swings

toward a phenomenon cave

mined by a looped hearing

---

[ongoing gem-sculpting]

---

a grinder handle revolves

calibrating chambers

into tennis balls of ingloos

warmed up by tender-breathed flints

---

an archive cascade

generates running lines

conjugating through whirlwind sockets

into a collage-fringed tail

---

[a sustainable fluid o-*zero*]
