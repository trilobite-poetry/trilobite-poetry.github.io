April 11, 2025 at 10:21PM---and after
{: .hyperspace }

Water
{: .hyperspace }

Sleep
{: .hyperspace }

To never be clever
{: .hyperspace }

No neighbors
{: .hyperspace }

but your own miniature ring
{: .hyperspace }

and a tremor in the bonds
{: .hyperspace }

means the terror of bankers does console
{: .hyperspace }

little blue bird makes a neat little hole
{: .hyperspace }

never more than that, than
{: .hyperspace }

Mighty
{: .hyperspace }

Mighty
{: .hyperspace }

despite the lichen there's buds on our tree
{: .hyperspace }

even if something's gone off with the grass
{: .hyperspace }

underneath, me
{: .hyperspace }

walking those courses bare headed
{: .hyperspace }

all about the park, less branches
{: .hyperspace }

and goes right up
{: .hyperspace }

makes it more lonely and therefore
{: .hyperspace }


somehow, certainly, frightening
{: .hyperspace }

Challenger
{: .hyperspace }

Protection
{: .hyperspace }

She says 'I can't'
{: .hyperspace }

'If I do that I'll topple'
{: .hyperspace }

'I'll topple'
{: .hyperspace }

It is two days before her birthday
{: .hyperspace }

there's that foot of a small column
{: .hyperspace }

everyone's talking about it
{: .hyperspace }

the interest of children, appearence and
{: .hyperspace }

habits and spawn points of creatures
{: .hyperspace }

seeing themselves on camera
{: .hyperspace }

where they were
{: .hyperspace }

various bug types
{: .hyperspace }

what are we doing
{: .hyperspace }

WILL I NEVER SEE
{: .hyperspace }

whatever's
{: .hyperspace }

the tall grass
{: .hyperspace }

four-way stop and flowering tree
{: .hyperspace }

dancers
{: .hyperspace }

fade into t-falcon
{: .hyperspace }

summer smell token farm with
{: .hyperspace }

geese bedded, fresh tilled field either side
{: .hyperspace }

the car
{: .hyperspace }

sleep
{: .hyperspace }

water goes a deeper green at the far end
{: .hyperspace }

happy birthday Tobin

he doesn't want his tooth to have any more

food

Notably, the swans
{: .hyperspace }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />


And after them, set high upon the ridge
{: .hyperspace }

looking down on the lake where the swans
{: .hyperspace }

are, the town
{: .hyperspace }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />

So many of them and every day, the swans,
{: .hyperspace }

and really no other birds on the water
{: .hyperspace }

except for them, they are lonely there
{: .hyperspace }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />

There are always more
{: .hyperspace }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />

Still days they turn about the surface and
{: .hyperspace }

the surface reflects them from the bottom
{: .hyperspace }

(or they push their heads and long necks
{: .hyperspace }

down into it), reflects also the green hillsides
{: .hyperspace }

about the lake, running down to it, various
{: .hyperspace }

sky
{: .hyperspace }


<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />

Not a valley just a declivity or dip in the
{: .hyperspace }

earth, all grass and hillside with the lake set
{: .hyperspace }

there and the swans there on it and the
{: .hyperspace }

town again up on the ridge one side or
{: .hyperspace }

stretch of the bowl, the others being bare
{: .hyperspace }

but for a road running to and from the town l
{: .hyperspace }

around the rim and then turning off away
{: .hyperspace }

from the whole thing, flat if it weren't for
{: .hyperspace }

that departure
{: .hyperspace }


<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />

Nothing about the town matters save that it
{: .hyperspace }

is situated there like that and that people
{: .hyperspace }

live there in it, nothing matters about the
{: .hyperspace }

people that live in the town other than their
{: .hyperspace }

long familiarity with the swans, the great
{: .hyperspace }

number of them down on the lake, their
{: .hyperspace }

shared understanding about them
{: .hyperspace }


That the swans could be expected to be
{: .hyperspace }

there, that the lake was calm and still more
{: .hyperspace }

often than it wasn't, so that the swans could
{: .hyperspace }

be sat upon high-polish, undisturbed
{: .hyperspace }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />


The importance of the town is that the
{: .hyperspace }

town's people consent, accept this, and
{: .hyperspace }

they do
{: .hyperspace }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />


Such that when a swan appears in the town,
{: .hyperspace }

in the middle of the one main road or on the
{: .hyperspace }

corner fronting the bank, they all ignore it
{: .hyperspace }

thoroughly and as though by acclaim or
{: .hyperspace }

popular agreement
{: .hyperspace }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />


On occasion one will enter someone's home,
{: .hyperspace }

this is also permitted, the dog won't even
{: .hyperspace }

bark
{: .hyperspace }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />


The situation
{: .hyperspace }

<hr style="margin: 1rem 0;" />


Until the lake turns over and the swans, the
{: .hyperspace }

town is gone

small and predatory bird
{: .hyperspace }

I see a black box
{: .hyperspace }

the men are smoking at their cars
{: .hyperspace }

at the doors of their cars
{: .hyperspace }

away from the cricket game
{: .hyperspace }

still further
{: .hyperspace }

one of them spies a snake and screams
{: .hyperspace }

What do I do
{: .hyperspace }

not wanting to be rude
{: .hyperspace }

Policing. Horror.
