## POOR SYLLOGISM

Nature reads us

---one twist of pure agony, then gone.

---

Effect of a line crossed by another line.

Nothing follows.


## NARRATIVE VOICE

He, the hero

Bent to enter

the inhuman room.
{: .ts3 }

---

Perception poured sideways, he could not master it.

Let it be a collective
{: .ts3 }

---

To present anew

the represented.
{: .ts3 }

---

When we fall, we fall

toward a center
{: .ts3 }

In constant choir

---

---our close too close to see.

---

Any word in quotes

Is understood to be a residue

Of unstated systems.

---

He's we, without question.
{: .ts3 }

## LIT

Little did I

---

Know---word of refusal---

---

word helping
{: .ts3 }

other words to
{: .ts3 }

---

talk about the whether---
{: .ts3 }

---

A way, away, to know.

---

\*
{: .ts3 }

---

The arc of a circle, magnified, gets
{: .ts3 }

Messy fast.

---

Re-

Verse, zoom out

to zero, refer-
{: .ts3 }

ring to ring
{: .ts3 }

after ring.
{: .ts3 }

---

O to sing of all who missing are!
{: .ts3 }

---

Earth's orbit, no---

Earth's obit

---

Announced to eye-lit heaven.

## NIXED WHY

Heat, any heat, encourages encounters.

---

Are you listening, atoms?
{: .ts3 }

Glistening will do.

---

As out of *scatter* comes
{: .ts3 }

a skater
{: .ts3 }

---

Or a kite without skies, *We*

---

is motivated by reason, *We*
{: .ts3 }

---

is calling, cooling to
{: .ts3 }

that One
{: .ts3 }

---

That collects an unlikely cloud, a final face.
