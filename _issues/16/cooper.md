<strong>The pool is the radio.</strong> People in the country used to feel so close to the pool
those days. It came out of my eyes (it went in). When I sat at the bottom I
felt the rough and the slick edges with the pruned pads of my fingers. When I
sat on the diving board it bounced lightly and the water was still. I cry. I
live. I feel the smell of chlorine on the palms of my hands. In. In the palms
of my hands. With. With the palms of my hands. Of. Of the palms of my hands.
Is. Is the palms of my hands. I feel the smell of chlorine is the palms of my
hands.
