## Take a look

Take history   
Take power   

---

At no point sufficient   
Accident of memory   

---

The common truth   
Conditions of visibility   

---

Unstable orbits   
Explain nothing   

---

In the history   
Of contestation   

---

Truth cure---it's a start   
Unfit for use   

---

*Nescio*, not knowing   
Task or matter   

---

Insufficient uncertainties   
Pose limits of understanding   

---

The commission   
Memory itself   

## Night Market

Rock or tree, inflexion   
of tree, wild asparagus   

---

and watercress, weeping   
and leaving, parting and   

---

fleeing, atmosphere   
as always the distance   

---

when the sun was still   
shining, scattering   

---

ardor, a metal form   
straight as a cypress   

---

useful and unnecessary   
single or double, green   

---

or variegated, sensation   
recording upheaval, desertion   

---

or deception to protect   
a love, lore on a tablet   

---

the song a minimal grammar,   
walls, bridges, cement could   

---

take the weight, lamentations   
a fire, the easy kill in the night   

## See the light

not the means

like a

small wave
{: .ts7 .nolinebreak }

in motion

---

you can't see

when you

look

peculiar
{: .ts3 }

energy behaviors

revolution without

traits

without
{: .ts4 }

the past

---

ground into dust

contradictory

resolutions
{: .ts7 }

present
{: .ts3 }

together (superposition)

see the inference

---

looks like a

proposition

makes sense

---

will make

a case of

interference

as of yet
{: .ts7 }

inhabiting

not
{: .ts3 }

gesturing

limits
{: .ts7 }

of nostalgia

extended dissolves

like writing

---

on the wall

little mother fucker
