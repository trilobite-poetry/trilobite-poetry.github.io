## Melancholia

Robert looks upon "Melancholia I" by Albrecht DÃ¼rer
hung on the wall by William Blake in his workshop.
{: .forenote }

The dog is skin and bones---   
and time has almost run out.   
*What is that?* A boy asks   
a marvelous stone wall.   
A hunk of granite, not yet   
turned into underserved   
beauty? The hammer lies   
dormant. A globe, unpainted.   
There's nowhere to go. Hell-   
hounds crawl out from   
behind the brightest star.   
Justice? No. No lifelong   
true love. No children out   
on the mezzanine. No horses   
under the willow trees. Only   
this. A large sullen angel   
who once could fly off   
into the depth of don't-   
remember-me---wingless now,   
stuck in this world   
where things can't be made in   
to be any different.   

## Robert Grows in Missouri

Outside Potosi, past the green gate, I wake up

one morning with Robert completely absent

from my mind. Nothing works out here unless I get up

and work it---the old iron stove, the well,

a message, hand delivered. I mistake a snake

for a worm---*The invisible worm*, my mind fires off,

*That flies in the night In the howling storm*

*whose dark secret love does thy life destroy*.

It's a snake though---no bigger than thumb to the tip of my finger.

I walk next to the big old tree struck by lightning

and the grey snake is long gone. I fail to identify

the name of the purple wildflowers that bust

up from the warm spring dirt. I pick up rocks---

quartz, garnet, everything shimmering in the sun

like fish scales under my childhood harbor. A friend

peels an orange while she looks at the field;

she's saying something, I can only half listen since the birds

are in heat all around us, the cedars thumping with calls,

*Come November*

*control-burn*
{: .ts10 .nolinebreak }

*the field, burning*
{: .ts16 .nolinebreak }

I watch the prairie where everything sprouts. *In November*,

she says, *the grass comes up to your waist*

*you wade in, you barely fit. November,*

*we put a flame to it*

*it's gone, faster than a thought*---
{: .ts13 .nolinebreak }

*I wish I could be there*, I say, watching

it--- hot and dazzling against

the midwest snow. The quick burn giving way to the slow

growth---each stalk of prairie grass getting up

out of the ground like a Robert poking up and singing

in the wind what Robert has been singing all these years,

a song so deep inside the chest it sounds like a storm,

*The world hurts*
{: .ts7 }

*The world hurts I can't control what I want* and now

I burn the field, I burn it, hoping

each time something better comes back.

## Patience, Hard Thing (Robert's Wet Dream)

You press yourself into me. A loss of embodied knowledge

as the brilliant thinker becomes thoughtless in sex. Oblique

obedience. Whose obeying whom? Not yet, not yet. You stroke

thought from bliss. Body slant with body. In the evening we drink

wine by the cool window---narrow light, light slipshods through

the blinds. We work ourselves up. Who's who in this nonlight? Mouth

tangles what I say. Little sycophant. A happy fresco makes the heart

beat fast. Call me your *good boy*. If you pin me to the wall, I'll spill

my fretted prophecy. Sleep skin

to skin. Tell me the hardest thing.

## The Ballad of Robert Blake

*
{: .g }

No one can hear anything
{: .g }

in a seashell
{: .g }

except me. I calibrate
{: .g }

to the dangers found
{: .g }

in a sheepfold.
{: .g }

A sheepfold lost now
{: .g }

in time. Why not?
{: .g }

---speak of a bridge of
{: .g }

bats, a bridge of
{: .g }

historical foreboding---
{: .g }

Why not? This is the timeless present, after all. In
{: .g }

fact the sound is not
{: .g }

blood nor air on the water
{: .g }

that pushed it out to shore. Not
{: .g }

the sound at all ---
{: .g }

*
{: .g }

To die before your time.
{: .g }

To refrain from the "immediately recognizable."
{: .g }

To refrain from bad habits and knots
{: .g }

of linguistic fortitude.
{: .g }

To fall in love with this language.
{: .g }

It's unimaginable, the sense of death
{: .g }

extended only by memory
{: .g }

(a cold shot of terrible
{: .g .ts4 }

whiskey is being poured
{: .g .ts4 }

into that small clear glass
{: .g .ts4 }

and this is what allows
{: .g .ts4 }

the impossible ballad
{: .g .ts4 }

to be written and failed
{: .g .ts4 }

until history finds
{: .g .ts4 }

its landscaped buried
{: .g .ts4 }

and burdened, and burdened,
{: .g .ts4 }

in the slow hand
{: .g .ts4 }

of the drunk and the poor
{: .g .ts4 }

who kept time to themselves
{: .g .ts4 }

even as you, yeah you, tried
{: .g .ts4 }

to steal it.)
{: .g .ts4 }

*
{: .g }

The incognito of "the human experience."
{: .g }

A non-human ball of light,
{: .g }

a ball of sickly green light,
{: .g }

a ball of blue light sucked
{: .g }

right out of deep time,
{: .g }

deep space, whatever, this
{: .g }

is my blue light, my sickly
{: .g }

green light, all movement
{: .g }

as potential, now, not
{: .g }

movement as forgotten
{: .g }

tendencies. I am a big idea
{: .g }

with big boots to fill. Here's
{: .g }

my belt buckle all aglimmer;
{: .g }

Here, everything inside me
{: .g }

has failed, has made me
{: .g }

cold, distant, even; no,
{: .g }

no, I like being a ball
{: .g }

of light --- why can't
{: .g }

you just
{: .g }

leave me
{: .g }

alone.
{: .g }

*
{: .g }

Let me argue in private ---
{: .g }

for Heaven's sake ---
{: .g }

The crow
{: .g }

The jackdaw
{: .g }

An easy mistake
{: .g }

from so far away
{: .g }

I've never thought about
{: .g }

seeing you again.
{: .g }

An easy mistake.
{: .g }

To have existed
{: .g }

so much
{: .g }

with you. I'm
{: .g }

disappearing, I'm
{: .g }

going back, the shell
{: .g }

is calling you to shore,
{: .g }

to say, this is where
{: .g }

voices get kept: if you
{: .g }

can't hear me
{: .g }

you've stopped listening.
{: .g }

*
{: .g }

Collapse (tell yourself).
{: .g }

Your radiant looks
{: .g }

have me
{: .g }

insatiable.
{: .g }

Temporal conundrum.
{: .g }

Temporal friction.
{: .g }

Evade a subject position
{: .g }

to be remembered as
{: .g }

omnipresent,
{: .g }

I mean omniscient. The story
{: .g }

must be told, totally.
{: .g }

The seagull made into
{: .g }

a puppet of his likenesses. Speaks,
{: .g }

finally, of only a chess
{: .g }

set collecting dust; bottles tucked
{: .g }

neatly into glass
{: .g }

cabinets. I won't
{: .g }

get to be.
{: .g }

Fateless, and in conversation,
{: .g }

I keep finding myself,
{: .g }

in the middle of
{: .g }

a conversation, I've
{: .g }

never wanted to have.
{: .g }


## The Last Performance

I let the rain go up

into my boots for you.

---

You pulled
{: .ts3 }

my hand

deep-
{: .ts6 .nolinebreak }

deep. When you said

*harder*,

I'd go harder. I
{: .ts3 }

---

had always dreamed

of wanting like that---

---

A horse whips around a corner.

A song plays off

into the distance. You get me

---

on film doing

what you like. *Don't show*

*anybody*, I whisper. You:

---

always a no show

at the very last minute---

---

of yourself. *Curtains!*,

heavy and red, rush outward.

---

I do
{: .ts6 }

your bidding.

---

I wave you off

the balustrade amidst

our showstopping

performance! Domestic.

Broken. Off the side,

---

I throw down what's left unsaid.

---

A formality? Ubetcha.

---

What if lovers let sleeping

dogs lie? Dear Beatrice!

Dear Helen! Mere gasps in the night---

---

I'd dance circles around

any ol bastards if only

to catch your little side eye.

---

I was peripheral.

Off in the wings.

---

Timing *is* everything

after all. I'm lapping

up the coast of you.

---

It was what you wanted.

---

The silence of the tongue.

The yearning. The want.

Never the thing itself.
