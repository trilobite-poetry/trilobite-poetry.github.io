October 2020–February 2021
{: .forenote }

With faint white clouds   
is the blue sky slashed.   
Bits of old flyers   
still stick to light poles.   
On stoops unrotten pumpkins sit   
and red and green   
paper coffee cups   
already crowd the grates. The air   
is sharp and sweet and musty with   
the mush of leaves, the last to be   
blown out of trees by night wind   
to reveal the city's   
perennial fruit   
eternal and out of reach.

A sycamore's yellow   
leaves hang over   
the oddball's shrine of broken toys.   
Hot pink graffiti on a dumpster reads "ouch."   
Runoff on black casements stains   
the rehabilitation center's   
brown bricks. Green algae tints   
a trough where tree roots tilt   
two sidewalk slabs together.   
Nearby, cryptic utility sigils   
conjure nothing.   
No light spills from windows   
under a funeral parlor's   
gothic-lettered sign.

Now and then along the street   
the sharp crack of an acorn   
on a car roof rings out.   
The moon dissolves   
in the sky like   
late snow. Skyward drags   
the machine its sound.   
A cold gust tugs at   
trashbags, nudges the guts   
of a torn trash bag.   
Sickly licorice-like fumes   
surround the residential facility.   
From the exit door's wire glass   
eyes peer out at nothing much.

An immense crane rests   
folded in half   
like an animal at its trough.   
Sharp slant of the late   
autumn sun warms   
muted beige rows of limestones.   
Tattered remnant of a   
yellow Moshiach flag   
hangs from a pole.   
Spent scratchies   
tumble among leaves.

A draft disturbs some tinsel hung   
in the window of the hardware store.   
A sun ray glints off a discarded   
water bottle's yellow piss.   
Through the chain link of the easement   
underneath the train tracks dry weeds spill.   
Zip tied to light poles,   
yellow plastic yard signs with   
"cash for diabetic strips"   
scrawled in sharpie shake   
as the wind rises and dies down.

A gray door shuts. In shade   
the street darkens. The words   
Jeff's Express LLC   
are printed on a sign.   
Shadows creep up the front   
of the dialysis center.   
In the twilight sky behind   
the 99¢ store's still-unlit sign   
burns,   
like hesperus,   
a crane's red warning light.

Green the flattened   
pack of Newports,   
green the pack of Kools.   
Along a building's ledges   
dish antennas roost   
black against the dusk.   
Golden drifts of fallen ash   
leaves lie. Light leaks out the sky.   
A security light's motion sensor   
registers a presence.   
Night as empty   
as the wish to forget,   
as a paper bag   
wet with blue paint.

Fog hides the crane's tip   
its red light slowly breathing.   
Among the leaves   
tiny plastic bottles sit   
like fallen fruit.   
Grease stains the sidewalk   
in front of a church.   
Around a construction site   
blue plywood sags.   
Shattered safety glass   
sparkles green under the   
street lamp. A deli's   
LED marquee silently scrolls.   
It says, "Ciggerettes."

Through bus windows   
faces preemptively empty themselves.   
Someone looks up at an ad for a law firm.   
Window LEDs of Tony's Deli   
cycle through a saccharine rainbow.   
Clinging to makeshift wooden benches   
vinyl stickers with red letters,   
black in streetlamp light,   
"We buy houses. We pay cash."

Autumn's evening   
air is shatterproof.   
Above the unlit coworking space,   
starfield of some skeletal   
highrise shimmers.   
Shutters wail like cataracts.   
A glass bottle   
only shatters.   
A child   
who spent the day in pleasure's   
endless resurrection sleeps.   
A lamp by the window,   
a radiator pipe   
clinking indecipherably.   
99¢ ATM $10 Bills.
