## Dark Room 125

Sewer needs to be flushed. Two open trays of developer and fixer on the
table.   
Spilled fixer with footprints on floor.

---

Darkroom to 127: sewer is the same source.

---

Dying hospital home for young and old alike.

---

Let me explain: you help people

---

because you want to see your daughter.

---

You can smell her inexpensive perfume. That's when you knew

---

she was with you. "Why didn't I get her those hundred-dollar

---

perfumes that I get for my girlfriends." Throughout your sleep journey

---

and twisting about.

## Sunday Morning

It's not that I dislike Tim McGraw.

Guy downstairs is playing him too loud.

---

I could say a word.

I've seen him in a tank top

---

holding an entire child in one arm

and a car seat with baby in another.

---

This room I'm in is vibrating.

I can knock on his door.

---

He has two vehicles, a white van

and a blue Dodge Charger.

## Summit

When I first came to America, I didn't know how to speak English.

---

I learned it watching *Menace II Society*.

---

The English spoken in the film aligns with my social, cultural and
economic location.

---

That is just the truth, no matter the failures I've accomplished.

---

"I feel sorry for your mother." I live in aspirational truths.

---

Not addicted to reality or even verisimilitude.

---

I've been to the meeting of the frog, toad and newt.

---

Let me stop lying. I only heard about the summit.
