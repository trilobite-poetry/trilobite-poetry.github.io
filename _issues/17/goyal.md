## insecticide

waterbug with an extraterrestrial face
{: .doublespace }

moves under a glass bowl and is
{: .doublespace }

still when I wake up.
{: .doublespace }

My precise foot crushes a
{: .doublespace }

cigarette next to its tomb,
{: .doublespace }

its transparent room.
{: .doublespace }

Its giant body
{: .doublespace }

dead by asphyxiation or a more
{: .doublespace }

commonplace sickness,
{: .doublespace }

or killed by boredom.
{: .doublespace }

Its giant body
{: .doublespace }

ended by loneliness, stilled
{: .doublespace }

in a room with cream walls
{: .doublespace }

and on them no pictures at all.
{: .doublespace }

## stinger

something bit my mother on the funicular
{: .doublespace }

some unseen cryptid around her unbalance
{: .doublespace }

a tilted carload of slipping feet and
{: .doublespace }

a strange wasp taking the train uphill.
{: .doublespace }

she rubbed the red into her skin
{: .doublespace .ts4 }

she pressed the welt now flattened
{: .doublespace .ts4 }

invisible when she unrolled her sleeves
{: .doublespace .ts4 }

we only knew when she couldn't sleep.
{: .doublespace .ts4 }

## morning cigarette

wingweary bee
{: .doublespace }

somehow afloat
{: .doublespace }

between two worlds
{: .doublespace }

nectar and smoke
{: .doublespace }
