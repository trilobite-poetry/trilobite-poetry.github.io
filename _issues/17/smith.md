## Cruellest Month

The cruellest month, so called,

April, driving north

radio aerated the plains

---

where the car overheated

on the sky

a plume of smoke
{: .ts3 }

---

helicopters

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clipped thin horizon,

wet grey cloud scope, gun-

---

metal bright
{: .ts6 }

1993, Interstate
{: .ts3 }

Waco as I relieved the radiator cap

---

carefully once cool,

gripped and turned, steam

hot

wet
{: .ts3 .nolinebreak }

---

to find a living

world, a way into the revolution

of words

---

inaugural violence

place condescended on

Brazos River grasses, repelled dreams

## Another Spring

Another spring,

the death of Robert Creeley,

also in Texas

---

I was beginning

to read Gore Vidal

on Timothy McVeigh

---

when he died,

backseat driving

along the Guadalupe range

---

in correspondence with his trajectory

our emails passed,

hawk landing in a sycamore

---

where I waited in late morning,

tired of the blowout, blowback,

State apparatus, narratives

---

like a dream, one chokes

on rural houses, telephone wire

electricity is everything

## Children

Lonely, dyslexic,

Houston, Denton, Garland

sex obsessed, bible-driven

---

"retardo", fourteen-year-old

mother, no father, boyfriends

abandonment, beatings, unwanted

---

sexual, they were children,

a child not ten years older than me

classmates didn't take a shine

---

aphasia, dysgraphia, excelled

in sports, crack shot

aim, snap, smack between the eyes

---

of a squirrel, my Daisy

sited rabbits or robins in South

Texas woods,

---

wounds, adolescent

Baptist, Camero or pick-up

bed asleep under stars

## Bone Flesh

Those days are blurry,

sex and church enmeshed

in me, the spirit

---

is a bone, is flesh
{: .ts3 }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeking pleasure

in cars, Forest Lane

---

wide Midwest sky,

word of the preacher
{: .ts3 }

Pauline, Protestant, Baptist

---

without any mind

interfering
{: .ts3 }

desire, what was an Adventist

---

those little, thin-wooden houses

painted white under
{: .ts3 }

billboards proclaiming

---

Christ
{: .ts6 }

and the Seven Seals
{: .ts3 }

one day, and go to heaven

## Merchant of Sensibility

How write a letter

to the dead, unknowing
{: .ts3 }

how then, not seeing

---

where the past and present grain

of voice or where my lived
{: .ts3 }

response could grasp

---

objective field,

alone in the afternoon, gas
{: .ts3 }

station pay phone, I called

---

a man I knew from high school

whose father had been shot dead
{: .ts3 }

in the liquor store he owned, a bullet

---

landed in my friend's face, my friend

killed the man with a shotgun
{: .ts3 }

(yes, a person of color, a person of left-

---

out, ruinous histories, of saddened,

bent, hoar-frosted November
{: .ts3 }

sedge, sod) and grease

---

under my nails, April wind and highway

shattering noise of cars,
{: .ts3 }

grey machines on the sky

---

I became a merchant of sensibility

a tribal instinct for garden
{: .ts3 }

spider webs in barbed-wire, rest

---

stop RVs, sticky hands of children reaching

for the door to the stall of the John
{: .ts3 }

inside my nighttime nightly-ness

---

web-perfect resinous streaks of yellow

on the sky, my eyes stung
{: .ts3 }

going home
