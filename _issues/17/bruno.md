## BREEZE BLOCK (DAY 5)

I'm proud of my below-

average score
{: .ts3 }

on a narcissism self-test. No
{: .ts6 }

imagination, though. Explain
{: .ts3 }

how money comes into it,

by which I mean
{: .ts3 }

homeownership.
{: .ts6 }

When I do smoke,
{: .ts3 }

it's always outside, at the corner

of the carport, underneath
{: .ts3 }

an overhanging shingle, at
{: .ts6 }

the side of the house
{: .ts3 }

farthest from the front

door. It would take
{: .ts3 }

eight steps
{: .ts6 }

along a narrow poured-
{: .ts3 }

concrete path

that runs between
{: .ts3 }

the house and my mother's
{: .ts6 }

plot of roses to reach
{: .ts3 }

the backyard through

a small iron gate.
{: .ts3 }

Two or three times
{: .ts6 }

a day, I smoke
{: .ts3 }

out there, kick the ashes

into the dirt, leaving a streak
{: .ts3 }

that fades in a day,
{: .ts6 }

and carry the butt through
{: .ts3 }

the gate to the trashcans.

I think of all that,
{: .ts3 }

and think of writing it

down, before reading in
{: .ts3 }

Chantal Akerman's *My Mother Laughs*
{: .ts6 }

"And then you can't smoke anymore,

if you do, I immediately can't breathe,

if you want to smoke go out on the terrace."

## Breeze Block 5, p.2 (of 2)

Two necessities
{: .ts3 }

for any piece
{: .ts6 }

of writing: a principle
{: .ts3 }

of inclusion (which is to say,

exclusion), and one
{: .ts3 }

of arrangement
{: .ts6 }

(that is, of order
{: .ts3 }

and measure). The gate

is unlocked. More exactly,
{: .ts3 }

it has no lock, since
{: .ts6 }

the last one broke off
{: .ts3 }

years ago. Anyone could

wander into our back
{: .ts3 }

yard at night. Odd,
{: .ts6 }

in that all the doors
{: .ts3 }

into the house have

not only locks but
{: .ts3 }

additional deadbolts,
{: .ts6 }

which my father, under
{: .ts3 }

some compulsion, double-checks

before bed. Anxious,
{: .ts3 }

but not panic-room
{: .ts6 }

paranoid: unlike many
{: .ts3 }

neighbors, we've never

installed electronic
{: .ts3 }

security or hired a private
{: .ts6 }

watchman. That's overkill
{: .ts3 }

on streets like ours,

which is only one way
{: .ts3 }

money comes into it.
{: .ts6 }

## BREEZE BLOCK 7

Waste not / want for nothing.

---

Streets are agents / black-clad, swept.
{: .ts3 }

---

All for naught / want not what?

---

Anything, but how? / Swept, shot, captured.
{: .ts3 }

---

Aim a camera down / a hall, a street

---

Inside, won't it blur / knocked from hand?
{: .ts3 }

---

Whatever it records / reports from a bullet

---

Omnidirectional / she never cared
{: .ts3 }

---

For commas for question / marks on questions

---

How I want you / want you to hear this
{: .ts3 }

---

Clear the grid that causes this / lens to read the sound

---

The shot and shooter / the sweep of the street
{: .ts3 }

---

The school where we're sent / where we learn to be agents

---

To pan past a pawnshop / to read an eyechart
{: .ts3 }

---

It's bidirectional / if the street is working

---

On what can be done / can be done to them
{: .ts3 }

---

Or what can be done / can be done for them

---

When all are released / from the school to the street
{: .ts3 }

---

We don't waste a moment / we learn to be free
