looking at a photo of myself at nine months   
smile spilling across my face   
insanely huge eyes glowing like headlights   
I like to think my heart   
makes this ridiculous face   
everytime I'm saved   
by the beauty of the world   
or the promise that you'd still go   
with me to Value Village   
even if you won the lottery   
happily spending an hour finding   
the perfect basket for my bag   
of 22 plastic lemons   
(marked down half price)   
it doesn't take much   
to miss our lives   
walk under the perfect   
dog shaped cloud   
never looking up   
"we should be grateful."   
you say,   
"Just look at that   
fucking sunset...."

he settled comfortably   
in the suburbs of morality   
by bitter lakes of an unsized canvas   
where good and bad never have features   

---

A giant fence houses him   
from wild gardens of strangers   
the reckless skeleton of his youth   
hangs in the wind   
his bones almost musical   
singing a Spanish lullaby   
he used to know the words to   

---

All of his snows melted   
by the same sun   
when he thinks of this   
he does not sleep   

---

his collection of books   
decorate an antique dresser   
his words collecting dust   
on yellowing pages   
silently staring out the window   
waiting

"My fake flowers died   
because I didn't pretend   
to water them"   
Mitch Hedberg's joke   
replays in my head   
while I plant yellow plastic flowers   
in every room   
this need to be surrounded   
by my favorite color   
without having to watch it fade   
a continuous soft whisper   
it's not all bad   
sending out search parties   
for silver linings   
attempting to write a hopeful poem   
while the world seems too dark   
to even dream in color   
while streets flood with water   
while news floods with war   
I know there's still beauty   
I can count on   
sit in. smile at.   
be grateful for

If Milwaukee Took a Selfie   
it wouldn't flex   
airbrush, apply filters or highlights   
soften the edges, heighten the contrast   
hold the camera up high to get a flattering angle of itself   
crop the photo strategically so it looks skinnier than it really is   
or so you can't see the part of the landscape unworthy of a postcard.   
It would stand before you stark, bold, beautiful   
giving you a direct stare, eyes gleaming with excitement, mischief, mystery   
while sipping on a damn good cup of coffee or beer   
depending on what time it took the photo...   
(unless it's summer, then it could be anytime really, all bets are off   
because, obviously, it has a festival to go to)   
If Milwaukee took a selfie,   
scars and flaws would be on display without apology   
"Milwaukee, home of cannibal killers and Happy Days"   
And an 85,000 dollar "Bronze Fonz" statue   
that people either love, or really fucking hate.   
It would not be a before photo, announcing it needs to start exercising   
after all the beer and cheese curds   
Milwaukee is aware of those problem areas   
it's working on them, it sees the potential and possibilities   
but if all you focus on are the flaws (it has some)   
a public education system needing serious aid and attention   
colossal socioeconomic inequalities ripping and clawing it....   
Milwaukee has so many areas still searching to be realized,   
but if that's ALL you see,   
you're missing the raw grittiness and beauty already shining and actualized   
If Milwaukee took a selfie   
It would not be an after photo showing off   
a perfectly chiseled ass, whitened teeth, designer athletic clothes   
inviting you to join it's fitness program   
Milwaukee is not eager to prove anything to you   
not trying to be high fashion with it's MilWOOKIE t-shirt and Brewer hat   
it might tag itself in it's own photos though,   
because Milwaukee is not arrogant, but it IS proud   
#brewcity #brewtown #thebrew #miltown #creamcity #cityoffestivals #thefuckinggoodland   
Okay, Milwaukee is VERY PROUD.   
If Milwaukee took a selfie   
it would want you in the photo too.   
Because it knows one of its most beautiful parts   
is YOU   
the people that live in it   
Milwaukee doesn't need to edit itself to look good   
it gets its authenticity, honesty, realness, from its people   
Before snapping the photo, Milwaukee would buy you a beer   
raise a glass, toast you with something like,   
"Cheers! We drink more in the 414!"   
then it would show you a portrait of a city   
for all it's faults and flaws   
no matter how many other places you find yourself   
will always feel like   
HOME.

my memory opens a door   
to that time   
you tried to pick   
which one of my legs   
was your favorite   
not thinking about you   
it's like pulling the plug in the bathtub   
telling the water   
it can go anywhere it wants
