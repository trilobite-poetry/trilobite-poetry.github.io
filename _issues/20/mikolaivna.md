1\. Where I will go.   
The nasturtiums in the vase faded from crimson to aubergine.   
Cohering practically to death.   
We talk about our respective hungers.   
And the truth is, neither one of us seems to be that hungry --- maybe there's something to be figured out still.   
What it means to have an art practice, set up a show, write a book, a conversation, a personal continuance.   
My clothes don't fit right now.   
The summer's seasonal abstraction of sustaining myself.   
This, too, will change.   
The fluctuation of my mind and interior.   
And the chatter goes on.   
And I will put on my teaching fit and make pretend.   
And everyone will be waiting on me, and everything shatters.

2\. Crying in the Cy Twombly room.   
The point is null.   
The nullest of sessions.   
I give into headlong stances.   
I give into.   
The point of defying a feeling.   
The defiance of feeling.   
The headstrong.   
I caught a cold.   
I took a hold of myself.   
Hermit summer's come to an end --- overdone..   
The slowing down again.   
The coffee cup again. My absolution again.   
The nasturtiums blowing up again. Red.

3\. Everything is timed perfectly and not.   
I eat cloves of garlic hoping to ward off the ills.   
Illness I will thoroughly sleep through.   
I had a dream --- the dream was fine, the dream took a dimensional stance   
The dream had notions of the sick.   
I've given into my mind.   
That conversation made me feel weird.   
I need him to stop swooning on me.   
Following rhythms and patterns.   
My dishes need to be washed, house needs to be cleaned.   
This I must do.   
I don't follow the writing practice I teach.   
"Vengenace" "Shades of Eternal Night"   
Granular pieces, SEPTA's withering service,, the men at the corner store.

4\. Cicadas, water maturation   
Chilly morning   
Once more   
The broken dock, a spine   
August falls   
Sun weakens   
In the light the city   
*Fatigue and smoke of nights*[^ashbery]   
To slow down   
Moderation spectrum   
Spirals   
Corossive   
Early cobalt   
Clears svelte   

[^ashbery]: John Ashbery

5\. It's raining like it does. How I like it. And all I can think about is you.   
It's kinda stupid like that. Kinda stupid   
To not sit with the unknowing fatality of possibility.   
The gray and the window doesn't shine.   
Hungover a little bit.   
Someone gave me a "liver" pill last night --- to go into overdrive, process the booze.   
Juliet tells me she has mice in the apartment. But what I meant was the little head games we all experience.   
Babycat curled up in the corner chair beneath the lamp.   
The bedroom, an accidental color scheme   
Germinating fall.   
I want this.   
I need to keep track of my thoughts.   
How intent and autonomous fate is.   
*The future is fortune's form*.[^hejinian] Everything can change.   

[^hejinian]: Lyn Hejinian

6\. The train car goes forward and I sit still   
The laws of motion:   
1\. An object at rest stays at rest, an object in motion stays in motion.   
2\. The acceleration of the object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.   
3\. Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite of the first;   
Velocity is involved in a pretense.   
The park's motion goes down, the books collect and there's nothing in my head.   
Hey you, you've got motion.   
The boulder rolls as the elevator ascends.   
The train spills my guts.   
I walked some I lost some.   
Amidst the augury of the fine disco tech the world grabs me by the shoulders.   
Brings me into the sleepless sphere, telling, it's time. It's time to flag, delineate and forget what I once knew.   
Knowledge spilled.

7\. I feel stupid writing something unporous as "freedom is in the leaving of things."   
Words' refusal to mind in the sun smashing me asking me for redirection.   
So this is what it's like.   
I want to leave space for opposition.   
Sitting in cigarette clouds.   
The finite begins stretching into an oblivion ---   
Matter's lacuna.   
How many choices will I make today?   
I want to leave--- mauve.]   
Folding towels together at the Blue Hole: the moment.   
There must be a rift --- a plunge one must make.   
How I pick my nails.   
*You must change your life*[^rilke]   
I look at myself, observing the shifts in my face and features   

[^rilke]: Rilke

8\. Smokers in Ridgewood.   
A shadow in my ear   
Eyes asunder   
Mounting vision   
Eclipsed   
I see, I look, I undo.   
Language a relationship.   
A language is a relationship.   
Incorporating oneself in its stitching   
The sudden, seamless comfort that encompasses the two.   
When does familiarity start to bind?   
Rupture's density   
That feared uncomfortable place   
And so a language; you must take a risk.
