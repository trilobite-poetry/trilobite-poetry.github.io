I pass by a smudge on the ground that may    
have been blood or spilled beans or somebody's    
baby you hear about such things left there    
because mom was in a hurry I keep    
going after all I'm in a hurry    
too but that smudge sticks with me seems to call    
to me I circle back I can't    
remember exactly where I'd seen it    
the light heavy by now with evening    
I ask a man if he's seen it describe    
the smudge as purplish resembling the face    
of a small child the man points that way    
I run anxious to find my baby I'm    
sure it was mine someone must've seen it

How hard it was to slow down and enter    
the world of the mollusk as it opened    
a door to let me in the walls gray-red    
wet and oozing like breath it took getting    
used to the way the floor zigzagged under    
my feet there was a guttural rhythmic    
music so we danced the mollusk's dance    
is green and moves the way waves move at low    
tide barely kissing the shore gentle soft    
as a foamy tongue then it was time for    
dinner we sat quite formally I was served    
such delicacies shark-fin surprise puffs    
of anemone canapes shaped like sand    
dollars crumbling softly on the tongue

I couldn't be reached for comment when screams    
ripped apart the night nor could the owls as    
they had decamped to a separate dark    
not accessible to our instruments    
their eyes turned completely inward the bees    
had plenty to say but their spokesperson    
was stopped at the border there was a snake    
everyone looked to for particularly    
wise remarks but all we found was a raw    
slither of skin in the deep everglades    
so we turned to the sky alas the clouds    
had frozen in abnegation perhaps    
the sea we surmised but it had sucked up    
into itself we stood bereft in the wet sand

Two men in a hurry talking about    
themselves on a crowded street while a girl    
plays nearby. The relationships unclear    
at first just a breath of fresh air is that    
your daughter oh how lovely nothing on    
the brain. The brain an organ that often    
takes flight though it can also take root.    
The little girl punches holes in the day    
with her memory. Someone hails the men    
from a long way off, well one of the men.    
Well what the hell. What the hell were you trying    
to say? Something along those lines, tender    
and pure, the girl will remember it years    
later, a pure line going from here to there.

As I stood on the corner I realized    
how rarely I'd actually stood on    
a streetcorner minding my business    
waiting for something to happen in my    
elbow my mother had often told me    
something would happen if only I'd wait    
I remember my father holding his    
elbow in the palm of his hand as he    
lied on the couch with the shades drawn moaning    
one afternoon so perhaps she had a point    
I saw a bird trapped in the window of    
a store the bird kept flying into    
and there I felt a sharp twang in my elbow    
as I bent to pick it out of the broken glass

Objects in the house as flotsam and jetsam    
in the mind. Gold rings shoved into drawers    
in the bathroom. Utensils sleeping in    
kitchen, knives and forks, peelers and plastic    
straws. Are all of the doors bolted and locked?    
The knob on the front door loose in the hand    
as it's pulled shut. Cards arrayed on mantel.    
Furnace rumbles to life. Water in kettle.    
I take back what I said, didn't mean it.    
I'd give anything not to have to look    
for that rolled-up tarp on a shelf somewhere    
in the garage. Water's boiling, timer's    
been set. Each says what the other's thinking,    
the mind blurs forward, a long, tangled cord.

Yesterday snow on the branches of the    
tree outside the front window and snow on    
the windshield of the car but it melts    
pretty quickly under the warm spring sun    
I look out my office window hoping    
to see kids at play on the hill beside    
the playground they are not there but I do see    
turkeys as I drive down the road to school    
or was it only the memory of    
having seen them a palimpsest of all    
the times I've come off the road onto    
the curve around the field into the lot    
finding them pecking away on the grass    
mama papa the whole turkey family

There's nothing to do but feel liberated    
try to express gratitude as best we    
can I'll dance a jig on the last breath of    
music before it winks out you follow    
the hieroglyphs etched by the bunnies    
hopping on the last patch of snow as it    
melts in the yard maybe we can both sing    
in unison to work up some of that    
liberated spirit I sit outside    
the liquor store for maybe an hour and    
tell myself it's coming the feeling is    
coming nothing can hold it back I think    
about going inside reluctantly    
though I start my car and drive home
