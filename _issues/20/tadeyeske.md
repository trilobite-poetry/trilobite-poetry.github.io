## LIFE IN GROCERY STORE LIGHTING

i try to catch the scent of things   
that almost happen   

---

the sky is damp in the center,   
crumpled, like a used tissue   

---

i can't find the grief   
that hides itself   
in errands   

---

if you asked me   
what hurts   
i could point   
or maybe just   
stand here   
let you   
figure it out   

---

the shape of my puddles   
as unique as   
teeth   

## WHAT IF YOU MET WHATEVER KEEPS THE WORLD HAPPENING

how much of my body   
is doing something   
i didn't authorize?   

---

there's an old VHS of a birthday   
i was so small i didn't have bones yet   
just feelings   

---

they say sodium kills you slowly   
but so does any decision   

---

sometimes i think about children   
not as people, but as weather patterns---   
pressure systems moving through   
what used to be my quiet   

---

my insides are bored of me   
i need to focus on boiling water   
organize the clothes i wear   
when i hate myself   

---

what if i build someone   
who thinks clouds are edible   
eats one just to see   

---

sometimes i like to name them   
like testing the temperature   
of a very deep lake   

---

if you scream into a hole   
the hole remembers   
holes have memories   

---

like small animals   
that made it halfway   
across the road   

## AFTERCARE

my mother texts   
to ask if i'm praying   

---

each answer i seek   
involves baking soda   

---

i pretend it's beautiful---   
how the hair on my arms   
looks darker and thicker   
when wet   

---

i wonder if any of my periods   
were actually miscarriages   

---

my eyes on the sky   
as if it's not   
looking back
