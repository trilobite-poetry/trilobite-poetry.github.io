God what a mess
{: .ts2 }

pacing a spiral
{: .ts4 }

working sun out
{: .ts2 }

morning
{: .nolinebreak .ts11 }

what’s on,
{: .nolinebreak .ts16 }

what channel.
{: .ts4 }

---

Your choosing sherbet shaded
{: .ts16 }

scrolling
{: .nolinebreak .ts31 }

a pile
{: .ts22 }

getting spacious at the bottom calamitous shake one
{: .ts15 }

two
{: .ts21 }

toppled flowers three.
{: .ts14 }

---

Angel in the mix decides. Hello cloud,
{: .ts5 }

good morning.
{: .ts7 }

---

&nbsp;Water no longer runs over rocks light

no longer anything. Invisible signal repeating environment

fast through a window
{: .ts2 }

sound
{: .ts4 }

a hot tip
{: .nolinebreak .ts10 }

taken to task.
{: .nolinebreak .ts17 }

---

Is all this more than I can realistically have
{: .ts4 }

and carry in a bowl my friend made.
{: .ts4 }

Lilac bush shaking
{: .ts7 }

late to bloom
{: .ts8 }

---

what mood am I in.
{: .ts17 }

---

Crystallizing the flux
{: .ts10 }

rambling wine glasses
{: .nolinebreak .ts23 }

loosening convention
{: .ts14 }

given timing
{: .nolinebreak .ts27 }

mismatched linens
{: .ts11 }

grapefruit spoons clam forks treat plates
{: .nolinebreak .ts21 }

---

you can have it all
{: .ts8 }

---

practice
{: .ts4 }

what everyone did all weekend.
{: .ts8 }

---

Finding that out unscrambled the trajectory of me
{: .ts10 }

a Virgo
{: .ts32 }

---

resonating then coming back
{: .ts15 }

rambling
{: .nolinebreak .ts30 }

&nbsp;a crystal bucket jangling
{: .ts15 }

went road side
{: .ts19 }

sound
{: .nolinebreak .ts28 }

a hike
{: .ts22 }

&nbsp;whistling through hair
{: .ts15 }

having a favorite river
{: .nolinebreak .ts26 }

I run back the guitarist

laying out what she takes apart
{: .ts2 }

and puts back

arranging the guitar moving
{: .nolinebreak .ts8 }

around it
{: .ts2 }

sliding
{: .nolinebreak .ts7 }

through it
{: .nolinebreak .ts13 }

blues
{: .ts6 }

all underneath
{: .nolinebreak .ts10 }

water
{: .ts2 }

alive in variation
{: .nolinebreak .ts7 }

long weaving

holy places
{: .nolinebreak .ts8 }

these songs available
{: .nolinebreak .ts16 }

for free
{: .ts2 }

how everyone in the parking lot played better than the festival.
{: .nolinebreak .ts8 }

These songs anyone could shake around see what comes out then give back
{: .ts4 }

then ride again. Good as birds

---

happening in the air on a big walk.
{: .ts6 }

Another mist colored way through
{: .ts2 }

whatever this rain cycle is
{: .nolinebreak .ts21 }

broadcast this morning only
{: .ts7 }

summoning material
{: .ts4 }

crossing fingers
{: .nolinebreak .ts17 }

letting the moon get into it
{: .ts6 }

hold it
{: .nolinebreak .ts21 }

like gems falling slow
{: .ts10 }

video
{: .ts7 }

deep in cosmology
{: .nolinebreak .ts13 }

surfacing a flash
{: .ts9 }

tumbling and clanging around the table
{: .ts11 }

arriving in time to eat toast with me.
{: .ts2 }

Whatever I thought I could energize drips
{: .nolinebreak .ts23 }

---

then quits.

Such is soul weather.
{: .nolinebreak .ts9 }

I came fucked into the kitchen

hardly dreaming
{: .nolinebreak .ts21 }

disappointing and real.
{: .ts10 }

Two guitars having breakfast together.
{: .ts13 }

---

All the sun need be
{: .ts16 }

the routine need rake the atmosphere of sediment
{: .ts13 }

messing with tuning
{: .ts16 }

---

Oats, whatever milk, various seeds, cinnamon, something to sweeten, reishi

to soften this whole
{: .ts21 }

brain spirit split easing questions like
{: .ts16 }

how are you living your life. Outside
{: .ts2 }

demolition derby coded a hazard to have a place to be

like work.
{: .ts21 }

I feel salted
{: .nolinebreak .ts33 }

come on take it
{: .ts2 }

take me
{: .nolinebreak .ts14 }

whatever personality of the week
{: .ts9 }

no
{: .nolinebreak .ts28 }

back to back
{: .ts11 }

light on light
{: .nolinebreak .ts21 }

eventless
{: .ts4 }

barely there music
{: .nolinebreak .ts11 }

someone on the radio explains
{: .nolinebreak .ts21 }

---

Okay. So.
{: .ts9 }

---

The kind of website I thought gone
{: .ts14 }

gumming up the hereafter
{: .ts8 }

&nbsp;soaked rose baby blue running it
{: .nolinebreak .ts21 }

H-O-T
{: .ts17 }

keeping it
{: .nolinebreak .ts22 }

L-I-T-E.
{: .ts20 }

Coming back clearer
{: .ts24 }

---

mirroring back chlorine in the water you get healed or hammered by

not a soul around
{: .ts10 }

having figured
{: .ts5 }

evil never takes a dip
{: .nolinebreak .ts13 }

never comes clean
{: .ts13 }

evil just
{: .ts13 }

gets so boring
{: .ts10 }

it gets syndicated
{: .nolinebreak .ts21 }

so personal
{: .ts13 }

I know it when I hear it
{: .nolinebreak .ts21 }
 
ugly actually
{: .ts5 }

so embarrassing to clock
{: .nolinebreak .ts16 }

spooned in my direction
{: .ts10 }

---

I want my time back
{: .ts2 }

---

Deserted arena, deserted star
{: .ts6 }

field mowed down gridded & mapped
{: .ts2 }

something unimaginable
{: .ts8 }

pile of cash
{: .ts21 }

dude who experiences
{: .ts21 }

nothing
{: .ts30 }

fucks up everything
{: .ts23 }

calls it information
{: .ts13 }

& repeats it.
{: .ts10 }

---

Let the sun back in
{: .ts7 }

supercharging memories
{: .ts2 }

I thought I was crazy to have
{: .ts6 }

only maybe everyone thought that
{: .ts4 }

---

another day cycling through sound

hearing static and being here and alive with it,
{: .ts4 }

loving the little changes.

---

Keep it on rose, high kicking cowgirl, big city at midnight,
{: .ts16 }

devil in the bathtub
{: .ts26 }

the galaxy
{: .ts28 }

poetry
{: .ts29 }

---

the kind of janky bottom feeding zone no one really makes anymore
{: .ts5 }

but you know you entered
{: .ts9 }

awake at freak hours
{: .nolinebreak .ts22 }

and you feel like you could have a beer here.
{: .ts10 }

---

I would meet you out late.

---

Here
{: .ts16 }

the truth about music money no mood
{: .ts19 }

money no what you search you obsess
{: .ts19 }

crush mix money
{: .ts19 }

war money.
{: .ts19 }

Stark with stars to boot.
{: .ts16 }

Everything
{: .ts13 }

stolen not to sustain but to be depraved
{: .nolinebreak .ts19 }

fund actual war waged via video game
{: .ts10 }

you could probably even purchase
{: .ts13 }

and spread out to make easy
{: .ts10 }

This is what happens
{: .ts3 }

---

when a stream gets hauled through a black box probably underground probably inside

a mountain destined to be blasted once the rest are blasted beyond recognizing, what
{: .ts2 }

happens when a stream gets drained and deranged and all anyone floating sees a filament

---

a stupid carnival prize with no way to light up or make noise. Trashed snack table, no wine.

How do you pay rent with that.
{: .ts6 }

How do you know it and forget and go about the day
{: .ts4 }

being a day.
{: .ts16 }

---

The sound water makes tumbling.

The sound rocks make clanging around, sliding,

taking surface to task,
{: .ts2 }

light dissolving inside, changing into something ripe to have faith in
{: .ts4 }

mystery so unlike
{: .ts9 }

what comes on automatically.
{: .ts9 }

Same at the gas station
{: .ts5 }

as the fruit store, ruining whatever the day might have been shaping up to hold
{: .ts7 }

---

like revelation inside being snowed in all week by a creek in Alabama
{: .ts9 }

like a dripping tunnel in Virginia full well bright morning star
{: .ts11 }

people should always be singing inside of
{: .ts17 }

like
{: .ts21 }

stay with me
{: .nolinebreak .ts28 }

a swimming hole in Kentucky
{: .ts10 }

a cave and pool system
{: .nolinebreak .ts27 }

like a sense of ceremony being carried forth by old songs asking you & me
{: .ts9 }

certain linens and movements
{: .ts20 }

like a codex of spaciousness and resonance and waves
{: .ts14 }
