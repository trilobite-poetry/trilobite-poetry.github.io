# Trilobite

`trilobite.bond` is built with [Jekyll], a static webpage
generator. Hosting via GitHub keeps our site free from both the
bloat and the over-designed quality of content management systems
such as WordPress; it also keeps *you*, the reader of fine
poetry, safe from the evils of Javascript and PHP.

*And* it keeps overhead low -- the only cost for holding this
site is the (ultimately unnecessary, but attractive) domain name
(less than $5.00/yr).

Anyone with even the most modest knowledge of HTML can create and
maintain a similar site. If you want to try and you'd like some
assistance, please [contact me]!
