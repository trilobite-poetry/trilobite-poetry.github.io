title: Adding a New Poem to the Current Issue
---

Two flavors of poem are currently supported, and two are under
development.

**Currently**:

-   Lineated poems;
-   Prose poetry

**In Development**:

-   Image-based poems
-   PDF-based poems

## Lineated poems

Lineated poems should be formatted in the following manner:

```

---
title: "POEM TITLE HERE"
contributor: "AUTHOR NAME HERE"
issue: 1
layout: poem
---

So much depends
                       <!--BLANK LINE INDICATES LINE BREAK-->
upon

---                    <!--THREE DASHES INDICATES NEW STANZA-->

a red wheel

barrow

---

glazed with rain

water

---

beside the white

chickens

```

## Prose poetry

```

---
title: "POEM TITLE HERE"
contributor: "AUTHOR NAME HERE"
issue: 2
layout: prose
---

This is a paragraph. Since it is poetry, anything goes, even
though it looks like prose.

This is a new paragraph -- the same "rules" apply here.

# Saving Poem Files

New poems must be saved in the directory
`Trilobite/issues/_current/`. They need to be saved as markdown
files (with a `.md` file extension), rather than ordinary
textfiles (`.txt` extension):

![How to Save Poem Files](saving.jpg)

Poems from previous issues should be transferred from the
`_current` folder to `Trilobite/issues/_past/ISSUE` (*e.g.*,
`Trilobite/issues/_past/2/splatter.md` for a poem from issue #2
titled "splatter").
