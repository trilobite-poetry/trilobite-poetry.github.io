To post any changes you've made to the website, open **Github
Desktop**.  This program synchronizes your local files to the
site.

Github has an irritating number of checks and balances to prevent
synchronization problems, but the steps are simple:

1. Hit "Fetch Origin" (see **Figure 1**). If changes have been
made to the site (by me, for example), the same button will
change from "Fetch" to "Pull." If this happens, hit "Pull" also.

2. Summarize your changes (*e.g.*, "Issue #1"). Optionally, write
a lengthier description of any changes.

3. "Commit to main."

4. Hit "Push Origin" to finalize your changes (see **Figure 2**).

5. Allow time for Jekyll to build the site before confirming that
results are as desired (~4-5min). Check `trilobite.bond` to
confirm everything is as it should be.
