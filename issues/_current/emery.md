## call and response

set a well tempered pulse and follow it   
gravity chases a drop of water from a leaf   
to a stream, down from a leaf down into a stream   
the world changes by a ripple's worth and plus   
or minus a ripple's worth from the time it dropped down   
from the leaf into the stream   

---

"draw a straight line and follow it"   
how to catch the spirit   
wild and unassuming rabbit line   
along a narrow group of hornbeam   
palatial undergrowth for a trio of fledglings   
call and response, chirping counterpoint   

---

A constant drift the frequency of carved earth   
the result of all gathered artifacts---   
the shimmer of time's oscillation accumulated---   
to what trigger does this cycle open?   

## september pulse wave

semi-regular pulsation shudder   
each spine stands at attention   
the pop of the human threshold   
capturing sizeable samples of   
salvation product set to some   
massive second hand ticking   
just outside the universe's blooming   
dress   

## reality filter

perfect composition is glowing on the

golden ground green'd around the glowing golden growth of light

right where imagination sits---
{: .ts10 }

just out of reach even from the tree of summer's end

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as autumn bends the heartwood and whose branches frame all

within a window's view

## A Module for Altitude

I am 30 000 ft up thinking abt the end of the world   
Same extra-conscious pressure   
that builds up under fruit dove wing   
launched by some action now well   
in time past spent past the point of no return   
it seems with each passing in the next ten years   
that inertia which pushes us all closer that which makes   
us feel the most like shit brings with it its own type of debt   
marked by locations of interest which can be pointed to and   
understood in such a way that I will not be able to look outside   
myself quite the same again a sort of trauma which grows older   
and matures caught in the rift of two outer-emotional halflives running   
as they would towards well infinity or that time when the fleshy memory   
is reformatted partitioned administrator X overgrown by the lichen of non-   
memory starved in the desert and left out under the sun which never sets   
outside of a dream where nothing is easy and the sky is truly clear all haze   
a gaussian machine of well treasured thought which vibrates around the   
edges to remind me of fragility of what reality I hold on to may also   
hold on to me   

## SONNET\_4

But outside&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dream&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each second subtracts   
Noonmorning mathematics scoring groove   
Tender count leaflets purchased on the bough   
Counterlever moonthought behind the mind   
My hereness blisters up to join all time   
Pop pop pop little universe bursting   
Here a wonderful thought & there & there   
Obsessive tendrils ever picking ghost notes   
Sound map regression echo location   
Delicate treading the rim of mine eye   
Call and response residual tones bend   
Alabaster meaningless to me now   

---

All my epiphanies left me bleeding   
Getting further to the middle of it   

## SONNET\_6

Hum hum I love my life and light hum hum   
synthesize'd fungus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same soul fungible   
a patching for a minor god and thick   
tendrils from said heaven trace\'d out in sine   
waves from a distant thought that numb spot there   
transposing divine constellation thought   
each pattern infinity well deep thought   
fractal insignificance pious spark   
the moral center seems to be offset   
the lowest common denominator   
hyper eternal catalyst mantra   
send bad vibes against the common goodness

in a psychic lock&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;living for today   
Wonder will we go to war tomorrow
