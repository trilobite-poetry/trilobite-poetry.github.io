```

Load up on guns. Bring your friends --
it's fun to lose and to pretend.
She's over-bored and self-assured:
"I know a dirty word."

With the lights out it's less dangerous.
Here we are now: entertain us.
I feel stupid and contagious.

a mulatto / an albino / a mosquito / my libido

I'm worse at what I do best,
and for this gift I feel blessed.
Our little group has always been,
and always will until the end.

And I forget just why I taste --
oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile.
I found it hard, it's hard to find --
whatever, never mind.

A denial.
