## Henry Holiday's "Dante And Beatrice" To Dorothy At Twenty

Florence, Italy. 1994
{: .forenote }

The facsimile first cast its firmer gaze, back to me.

Patricio Gimeno's, in six decades like bared

Teeth, in Bizzell Library. Durante prematurely

gray for twenty. Triune women paced their scalene

---

unconcern, his thrice-blessed leading lady only

ever musing down the road. I stood in a sightline's

way to be thrown to scenes of Fiorenza, Professor

Bizzari, and dubbed "*Dantista Dilettantesca*"

---

for three dolled-up years in streets after parting from

my own grade-school puppy obsession---a cistern

my maybe-gay-but-catholic-raised heart tried hard

---

not to hold and bungled---in streets with Discman

drowning to a *Naked Eyes* tune on loop. Regina,

I love you but never said it to your stupid face.

## Dorothy's Arrival In Rio De Janeiro

Saudade Day. January 30<sup>th</sup> 2000
{: .forenote }

My stowaway, *Lament At 26*, (paltry wedlock

of inner rote-work demons) ain't Bill battling overhead

luggage compartment's Thermopylae, peeking back

---

at a stewardess bend and ask girls if they need

"*sacos de castanhas,*" an exosolar

cordiality to our skyhook ears' first seed

---

to root Portuguese. I wanted her

too, her cashew Hailstone Sequence

in peevish *meninas'* laughter---

---

Boolean increments,

lust and feckless fun,

the attendant's

---

sigh, our wan

button

---

&mdash;

---

when

we drove

(Rio in

---

rearview) to strive,

to hope through fissure,

shadowland marriage---love

---

birds nursed our iron eggs for

multilingual Regina's "p√µe

ovos de ferro" as translator,

---

way past Eduardo Bizzari or cloy-

ing *Rainfire* James Taylor and Harriet

Onus's best, scraped barrels of "*Devil to Pay*

---

*In Backlands,*" daquiris' downfalls, and pages to heat

our Pauline bed's moony, harsher sheets. I name them her heart.

## Lament At 26

Oklahoma. May 20<sup>th</sup> 1999
{: .forenote }

This odd absence

turns eight today.

Will he dance mad

---

as a cootied

second-grader?

Or will he wax

---

somber, stricken

with bone cancer?

Will he fester?

---

Or play the game

a prodigal

grandmaster? Will

---

he waver---or

scream, immortal?
