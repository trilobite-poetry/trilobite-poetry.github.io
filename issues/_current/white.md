Sandwiches and closets and collected oils and balls and sweet breads and toads and colored choice sticks and little steady mirrors and little puddings and almost any pies and between handies and mittens and clouds and old things and butter and a soiled omelette and pieces of oat meal and a stage.

---

The real white way is with a color and powders are green and roses are vacant and beets real beets have balls.

---

The whole thing that shows the result is the little way that the balls and the pieces that are with them which are not birds as they are older do not measure the distance between a cover and a calendar.

---

Show sighs in must and leave the place leave the place dark with a broom a tall broom with locusts and resigned balls and nearly a sweet shout a sweet shout in pills.

---

Mixed balls.

---

She is white and reasonable and makes little balls.

---

Fancy balls.

---

Piles of balls.

---

Dear Genevieve. Do say where you heard them speak of the decision they had come to not to have masked balls.

---

I didn't say. They always have masked balls.

---

Yes we do hear one another and yet what are called voices the best decision in telling of balls.

---

Masked balls.

---

Yes masked balls.

---

By this easily questioned I know that there are splendid balls. Balls and balls of them I can tell you that I was not prepared for that.

---

A little boy was playing marbles with soldiers, he was rolling the balls and knocking down the soldiers.

---

And what do you think of balls.

---

How happily I pass the rolling fields of brass with the balls that say not so.

---

They indicate that one and I indicate one and they indicate one and the past we do not remember butter balls or sandwiches or velvet.

---

No nor can there be moments to more than Italians to more than balls to more than canals.

---

Very well. Balls. Very well.

---

Helen is a nightingale with petals of which with plenty of copper balls of noises in a gather with when speckled of finery. She dresses simply.

---

With wishes and crosses and shawls and alls alls bells balls cover how do you do deniably.

---

Balls are plural. Of course.

---

History must not be about=Dogs and balls in all.

---

To play with balls.

---

Birds will need balls.

---

Birds and balls and trout and seagulls and their nests follow me.

---

What do they think of a garden which they have when they look wherever they may place one

---

two or three balls.

---

Balls may be black or red larger smaller or medium sized and oi no return.

---

Was Asleep did not mind because he preferred sticks to balls and really Francis and Fanny Lucy did not care much for balls to play with either except just to roll between their legs when they stood with their legs apart and could get somebody to roll the ball under them. Pass through the hole is what they called it. That was what they did. There were no dogs and everything was calm.

---

He let go her he called out Jesus Christ my balls and he went under and she went under, they were neither of them drowned but they might have been.



## Trembling Afternoon



July 11, 2022
{: .forenote}



So there's

---

been a

---

nuclear attack.

---

Don't ask me

---

how or why,

---

just know that

---

the big one

---

has hit, ok? So,

---

what do we do?

---

There are three

---

important steps

---

that I want

---

you to

---

remember.

---

Step one:

---

get inside, fast.

---

You,

---

your friends,

---

your family:

---

get inside.

---

And no,

---

staying in

---

the car

---

is not an option.

---

You need

---

to get

---

into a building

---

and move away

---

from the windows.

---

Step two: stay

---

inside. Shut all

---

doors and windows.

---

Have a basement?

---

Head there.

---

If you don't

---

have one, get

---

as far into

---

the middle of

---

the building

---

as possible.

---

If you were

---

outside

---

after the blast,

---

get clean

---

immediately.

---

Remove and

---

bag all outer

---

clothing to keep

---

radioactive dust

---

or ash

---

away from

---

your body.

---

Step three:

---

stay tuned.

---

Follow media for

---

more information.

---

Don't forget

---

to sign up

---

for Notify

---

NYC for

---

official alerts

---

and updates.

---

And don't

---

go outside

---

until

---

officials say

---

it's safe.

---

Alright?

---

You got

---

this.
