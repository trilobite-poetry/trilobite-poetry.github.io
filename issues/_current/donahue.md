## THE PALACE OF BOUNDLESS COLD II

---
{: .big }

*children*
{: .ts18 }

---

Astonished children  
slowly approaching a huge  
oak the storm tipped  
across the street in the night.  
They slip past the orange cones.  
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Small girl, delighting,  
calling to her brother from  
the crown of the tree  
their tricycles left to roll  
down the slight slant of the street.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

All kids, birds again,  
singing out in the flames of  
autumn's downthrown crown.  
"Not all forms are forms of death,"  
they would seem to be singing.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Weeks later, a gleam  
of reddish gold, a single  
strand of hair catches  
the light on the couch where your  
tresses fell loose about you.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

(I concluded, then,  
your silence was not an  
oversight, that, at  
some point, it occurred to you  
to give me no further sign.)
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

All is burning now  
in the places of past joys.  
The playground and creek  
where I would take the children  
are bursts of flame on the news.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---

*all those messages*
{: .ts18 }

---

Your wife made you feel  
only lonely, yet you stayed.  
You forgot our hours  
together, our faces close,  
confessing our deepest joys.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

My note was playful.  
I put all my charm into it,  
Still, you don't write back.  
Rains have flooded the garden.  
Petals go spiraling off.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

As sick as I am  
my beauty will not weaken.  
Too listless to brush  
my hair, I just push it back,  
tresses that once dazzled you.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

All those messages  
sent out in the fever of  
my depraved nights,  
that would have ruined us both,  
did you keep at least a few?
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

*snake*
{: .ts14 }

---
{: .big }

Words in black cursive  
write themselves across the road.  
A snake at mid-day.  
An elegant hand renders  
an otherworldly update.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

This is the moment,  
in your many years of life,  
a black snake appears.  
Others will say: "It's nothing,  
it doesn't mean anything."
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Such a complex truth  
the snake writes on the road,  
shaping no letters,  
just the black, slanting loops  
of the moment of writing.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

The snake says just this:  
"I have unraveled a thread  
in the veil between  
two worlds, the visible one,  
and the one I return to."
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

So many, long gone,  
are frolicking in a dream.  
The shore at evening,  
those boulders where the waves break.  
The long gone keep arriving.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Such beautiful light  
after days at the deathbed.  
Heading to the cars,  
siblings, now fatherless,  
each taking out a key.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

(You will die lonely  
having inspired no one  
to be with you, then,  
or worse, your spouse, who'll find  
some last way to make you feel bad.)
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Fifty years from now  
this will all be a desert.  
Now and then, a flood.  
You will be forgotten but  
your torments will continue.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

How this came to be  
not even the chill wet wind  
in which the forest  
trembles, has any idea,  
coming in gusts from the east.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

I am fading out.  
Habitual gestures are  
what I am known by.  
I keep my tears to myself.  
Sometimes a breeze dries my face.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Fire burns unseen  
inside the tree: a pillar  
of bright combustion,  
the core of still living wood.  
(Even the roots are burning.)
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

All seems pale today,  
as if color had been kept  
from returning, from  
wherever it goes at night.  
As if light is still dreaming.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

After such singing  
no one is ever the same.  
Grief and wonder flow  
in and through and out of us  
long after silence returns.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

To lose all like that  
is so cruel, then to be old,  
kneel on a sidewalk,  
cry, nowhere to go. Winter  
dark, ice gleaming on the streets.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

---
{: .big }

## THE PALACE OF BOUNDLESS COLD III

---
{: .big }

When I was a child  
they gave ballet lessons there,  
but it cost too much.  
That was the first of my dreams  
making me ache so, like this.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Nights of the full moon  
I see how empty my bed.  
Sheets glow like a field  
of fresh snow, where, if I lie  
down, no one will ever find me.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

So much that mattered  
drifts over the horizon  
like chunks of Greenland  
turning back into water,  
the essential element.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---

*lying alone*
{: .ts16 }

---

Awake, past midnight.  
so much love was mistaken.  
Lying here, alone.  
The night sky is pale but dense.  
Heaven is hidden from me.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Lying here, alone.  
The world still claims it's summer  
but winter fills me.  
My fields are bare, my woods, dull.  
The trees are sealed in ice.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Hungry and asleep  
I dream of a feast, and those  
much missed are there,  
in my head, chatting, laughing,  
as I lie alone in the dark.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

It was their last night  
before catastrophe struck.  
Looked back on, all  
seems fraught. But that is wrong.  
They lay happily entwined.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Certain things you said,  
so close, barely whispering,  
in the pillowed dark,  
they still thrill me. Though long  
alone, I feel you are close.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

How desolate now  
those once cherished places,  
those rocks by the sea  
the waves still erupt against,  
where a boy and a girl once kissed.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Lying here, alone,  
after midnight, looking up  
through a small gap in the trees.  
For me, no moon will return,  
even when shining and full.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Never to see you  
after that last night of love  
except in my head  
where you are, as you were then,  
like an amorous shadow.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

The light seems certain.  
But when I look up again,  
the glow on the ground  
is no longer happening.  
The grass sinks into shadow.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

*more mist*
{: .ts15 }

---

A mist in the trees  
in shadows, and in sunlight.  
Early radiance,  
while awakening inside  
a house, a spouse is cursing.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

What grief can find you?  
You are hiding in a mist.  
You're no longer you  
amid glowing molecules  
that coil, and drift, and dispel.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

The air seems chalky.  
As in school, the lesson done,  
the board is erased.  
No one after will ever  
know what was once written.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

In such mist lovers  
might decide to meet, despite  
the full light of day.  
They might slip out of their bodies  
and lie down in the shining.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

A mist out of which  
the perceptible steps forth.  
Much not given the  
senses is there as well, so  
bright, close to becoming thought.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

The first ideas  
that ever excited me  
somehow have returned,  
ready to be thought anew,  
at the far end of a mist.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Mist conceals the field.  
It cannot be said for sure  
if the deer are there.  
They could be made of fire,  
grazing deep inside the mist.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Through their shining webs  
the thoughts of spiders arrive.  
The web is what thinks,  
after the rain, glittering,  
silver, in a silver mist.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Soaked and glowing world,  
the sun's no longer needed.  
Secondary light  
is rising from the drenched ground,  
much as the mystics foresaw.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

What is awaited?  
Stillness intensifies.  
The day may yet rain.  
Mist is gathering elsewhere.  
These last moments are endless.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

The mist? Only dust,  
freed by a construction site,  
drifting through the trees.  
Voices, and clattering tools,  
tearing, grinding, then silence.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Nothing on the screen.  
What else do I log on for  
but for word from you?  
Months since any dirty talk  
found its way to your fingers.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Weeks now of no word.  
The simplest of your whispers,  
some barely a gasp,  
I hear again, in my mind,  
and lie sleepless, and longing.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Fire-pit smoke fills  
the forest hollows at night,  
hangs over the stream,  
filters into the houses  
and sets off fire alarms.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Cardboard and tin cans  
absorbing the rain, or, re-  
sounding with each drop,  
empty trash cans on the curb.  
I hear all that time touches.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

You were years ago,  
but I have not forgotten:  
Lying side by side,  
our whispers lost in the mist  
of exuberant rainfall.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

We never touched.  
Talking was all we needed.  
Spectacular chat!  
You have stepped into death.  
I'm alone in this silence.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Living in sight of  
a mountain might clarify  
my loss. A mountain  
of snow, bare stone shining bright  
above all this misery.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

These are offerings  
to quicken oblivion.  
I'm a living shadow  
at the altar of full noon,  
done with ever having been.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

*ancestors*
{: .ts14 }

---
{: .big }

Mother, nothing more  
than a vivid memory.  
Father, nothing more  
than wind kicking up leaves  
or dragging away the house.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Father, nothing more  
than a glaze of rainwater.  
Mother, nothing more  
than silver light rising  
from a wet and empty field.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Mother, nothing more  
than a chunk of white crystal.  
Father, nothing more  
than an idle building site:  
slabs, beams, rebar, and gravel.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Father, nothing more  
than clouds along a cliff-face.  
Mother, nothing more  
than a pilgrim on a path  
that vanishes into mist.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Mother, nothing more  
than cloth dipped in crimson.  
Father, nothing more than  
a decorative feather  
in a parking lot briar.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Father, nothing more  
than warm welcome in the void.  
Mother, nothing more  
Than a song before bedtime  
after a very long day.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Mother, nothing more  
than the least possible light.  
Father, nothing more  
than last shadows at twilight,  
night now free to overwhelm.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Father, nothing more  
than wry, affectionate words.  
Mother, nothing more  
than pathos, hilarity  
in a quick-witted aside.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Mother, nothing more  
than a brush dipped in ink.  
Father, nothing more  
than an ink-stroke on a scroll  
that depicts a parasol.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Hand, scooping damp earth  
in a desert, last of night's  
cool, leaving the air  
as the light rises, slowly,  
behind a mountain that looks black.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

I told you things that  
no one else will ever know.  
Is that why you left?  
No need to wait for winter.  
The deepest cold drifts through me.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Once red leaves, gone.  
Your agony is over.  
The tree, still half green,  
twists in dismay at what time  
is about to do to it.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

In the rotunda  
a pianist plays Bach for  
the waiting patients.  
The notes float up to them  
as they await their treatments.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---

*what I wanted*
{: .ts14 }

---

I wanted to be  
simply there to be kissed,  
like a servant called  
late at night to the bedroom  
when the King is off to war.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

I wanted to be,  
A full cup at your dry lips,  
a delicious sip,  
wine drunk in the cool night air  
as you think of someone else.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

I wanted to be  
punished and forgiven,  
at your whim, by you,  
on a night consecrated  
to a lighthearted scandal.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

I wanted to be  
ashes in your hearth, heaped  
after a great blaze,  
be a cinder aglow from  
the touch of your fingertips.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Days are wet and dark.  
The moon, having wept all night,  
has thrown itself off  
the cliff of the horizon  
and is drowning in the sun.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Flits, fluffs, preens, the wren  
opens its wings to the sun,  
then seems to cry out.  
I wonder, is that song yours,  
wherever you now are?
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

That may be a land  
of always falling blossoms  
and quiet grieving.  
But I'm not there. I'm here,  
alone at night, sipping wine.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

## THE PALACE OF BOUNDLESS COLD IV

---
{: .big }

My soul's gone ahead,  
into those far away hills,  
where the moon rises.  
But I'm still in a basement,  
with only one small window.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Never suspected  
of any beliefs at all,  
a friend, just leaving  
on a brutal pilgrimage  
of fasting, penance, and prayer.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

I'm on the zoom screen.  
My face is like the face of  
an astronaut, caught  
outside the capsule. No one  
is going to let me in.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

When I left the world  
the last eggplant had ripened  
in its small pot on  
the sunny end of the porch,  
violet, as is deep space.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

On a huge window  
a grasshopper clings in  
absolute stillness,  
perceiving, as befits him,  
space, air, light, heat, and distance.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Pure and blue the moon  
was there for a full moment  
in the glowing rush  
above the well of despair  
often confused with your house.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Close to full the moon  
above the oblong of black  
known to be a street,  
a single star beside it,  
less lifeless than you are, now.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Nothing much is done  
but all now seems different.  
Must be the fresh wind.  
Must be the disappearance  
of the last possible light.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Then you spoke your mind  
and imperiled your income.  
No better off now  
than a beggar with a bowl,  
saying please, please, forgive me.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

I would rather be  
on a lake, late afternoon,  
maybe one other  
cabin in sight, on the far  
shore, where the sun is failing.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Fate put you in this  
body and fate will free you,  
so you can go back  
to just dreaming all the time  
where there's no dream and no you.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---

*Korean woman*
{: .ts15 }

---

My perfection had  
proved to be debilitating.  
I needed time off.  
My parents got real worried.  
All I did was lie in bed.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Life was doing to  
my moods what Japan had done  
to Korea, long  
ago, in history, and  
now, secretly, in my head.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

I felt occupied  
and kept alive only for  
what others could do  
to me, and yes, mostly men,  
sent here to destroy our world.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

I am the palest  
Asian girl you'll ever see.  
In another life  
I was Scandinavian,  
But now I'm just scared, all the time.
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Having renounced  
the senses I, nonetheless,  
know they are still there.  
Sometimes, by mistake, I still  
see, smell, taste, touch, and hear.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

The doctor gave me  
pills but I'm afraid of them.  
Old people get them,  
those whose hearts have gone wild.  
Those who awake bewildered.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

My basement study  
is a grave with a window.  
I can look out and  
see the life I'm no longer  
concerned with understanding.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

Loved and more than  
once but never not un-  
happy. Who did I  
devastate in some former  
life that I'm so lonely now?
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

This memory has  
no other place to go, now,  
but your head. All those  
other minds do not exist,  
those there when all that happened.
{: .ts4 }

---
{: .big }

*
{: .ts12 }

---
{: .big }

If you don't sleep well  
think of the corpse of Jesus,  
his nights in the tomb  
draped in rough cloth, motionless,  
so tortured, but then at peace.
{: .ts4 }
