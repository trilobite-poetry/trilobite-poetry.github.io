## January 22

Cole Swensen: should something happen

to the heart.
{: .indent8 .nolinebreak}

You:

a punctuation
{: .indent2 .nolinebreak}

based on elevation,
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

---

thin air. More buoyant

---

than I've seen you

. The composition
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

of a grain of sand. How mountains,

---

weather, artefacts of library archive. The needle

---

and the ink-stained press.

A cloud
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

of campfire sparks.
{: .indent9 .nolinebreak}

---

I work a desire

for an echo
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

---

beyond laundry,

that single, unbroken sentence.
{: .indent3 .nolinebreak}

---

Our young ladies

reclaim two-day-old snow, the distance
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

of arm's reach

, introducing chorus
{: .indent8 .nolinebreak}

---

across this former

stark white surface.
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

## January 23

Deep in the mountains

you write
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

about childbirth, preeclampsia

, and what twice
{: .indent7 .nolinebreak}

---

nearly killed you. A fugue

through which
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

---

one might ascertain

. You riff
{: .indent7 .nolinebreak}

on *Downton Abbey*'s Lady Sybil

Crawley, who chanced
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

---

the same path

you survived.
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

---

Monday morning: cellphone alarm

and the weight

of the future. Our two
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

---

begin breakfast, teeth, fresh clothes

all
{: .indent7 .nolinebreak}

our shallow disruptions.

---

The story

of the story
{: .indent3 .nolinebreak}

of a dawn
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

that arises, pre-dawn. The body

---

should not be forced.

## January 24

Yesterday, the letters

our daughters composed
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

landed safe, at your studio. This Canada Post distance

---

a full

week. Last night,
{: .indent4 .nolinebreak}

the musicians, you suspect

, that kept you awake,
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

---

their talk

through adjoining walls. You
{: .indent2 .nolinebreak}

---

are in Banff

writing poems, I
{: .indent3 .nolinebreak}

remain in our bedroom

, looking west, seeking out
{: .indent4 .nolinebreak}

---

the source of this chill. Today these words

sketched
{: .indent7 .nolinebreak}

from underneath the particles

---

of cat dander, school lunches, recycling. This infinite cycle

---

of restless calm. It is the only way

I can possibly work.
{: .indent7 .nolinebreak}

## January 25

What peck of dirt

to regulate vowels;
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

the ability to live

line by line, a punctuation
{: .indent3 .nolinebreak}

---

of laundry, dishes, litter, groceries. Daily duo

of school lunches.

Robert Kroetsch: Part of living together
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

---

is the allowing

for repetition. What peck of dirt, under
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

new snow. This list

---

of dead leaves

, scraped
{: .indent4 .nolinebreak}

beyond the plow's blade.
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

---

First thing: walking heavy

upon frozen ground.
{: .indent7 .nolinebreak}

## January 26

This morning, the relief

of a snow day: buses cancelled,
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

I return to bed.

## January 27

A half-brother I've met only once

invites me
{: .indent7 .nolinebreak}

to Vegas in May, for

---

a sibling weekend. Starting from fragments,

it is how

they assemble. Light-coloured pieces
{: .indent3 .nolinebreak}

---

set out

---

on dark soil.

When I say
{: .indent4 .nolinebreak}

what I write
{: .indent7 .nolinebreak}

is literal, this

---

is literal.

You fly home tomorrow, already
{: .indent3 .nolinebreak}

---

in Calgary, again. Having returned

---

down the foothills. I can tell you, geography

---

is meaningless.

Your absence, reduced
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}

to simple binary: you

are not here.
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

## January 28

Midway:

from one edge of the continent
{: .indent4 .nolinebreak}

---

you soar.

The heart absorbs surfaces, heat. As you rise,
{: .indent2 .nolinebreak}

---

to draw

an ink-white sentence, blue.
{: .indent4 .nolinebreak}

---

You

are facing east, east, this passage
{: .indent2 .nolinebreak}

---

of things in air

like water, diction. Incertitude,
{: .indent5 .nolinebreak}

and astonishment. And now,

---

we load into the car

to greet you.
{: .indent6 .nolinebreak}
