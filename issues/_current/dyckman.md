## Dear Temptation

you appear from some far place
{: .indent2 }

---

offer a sandwich as if after-life can mend
{: .indent3 }

---

&nbsp;

---

your kindness is long delayed
{: .indent2 }

---

&nbsp;

---

I close my eyes against it
{: .indent3 }

yet take a small bite
{: .indent2 }

---

&nbsp;

---

irresistible longing on the tongue
{: .indent4 }

## Dear Missing

where are you? I am groping in the dark aware of what isn't here

the recalled and reinvented my body wants to swallow whole

what is invisible all before me longs to be absorbed

disbelief runs from my back to the length of my right leg

skin pales so much might be lost of this night.

## Dear Pause

last night I held all the words I'd hoped
{: .indent1 }

---

to say to you
{: .indent1 }

---

this morning I have no idea of the sound
{: .indent1 }

---

of those
{: .indent1 }

---

nor can I remember
{: .indent1 }

---

who you are
{: .indent1 }

---

why I might have wanted
{: .indent1 }

---

to address you with such love
{: .indent1 }

## Dear Touch

you
{: .indent2 }

are
{: .indent3 .nolinebreak}

making
{: .indent4 .nolinebreak}

yourself

known waking me
{: .indent2 }

before dawn ancestral
{: .indent2 }

shades

tracing skin along my
{: .indent2 }

arm

thinned memory those
{: .indent2 }

lifting me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then gone
{: .indent2 }

## Dear Drawn From

you someplace now awake, you wanting what

---

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my

---

again, awash, to rest tongue as night follows day cloud-noise

---

reseeding truth of job, sea, the body

---

fingering sense, an offer here beyond the known

---

lingers, responds between the rocks, remembers disordered prophecies

---

the protected hand, the thinning words polished after letters arrive
