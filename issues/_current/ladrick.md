Let me start over, Sylvia,

a woman I knew once

pushed me with my own hands,

---

the force in proportion to the smallness

of my palms. Psychics scare me just because

thinking I know what they will tell me isn't

---

what makes it real. They could

---

and I assume there's more than one at the time

but the news wouldn't be good, you know?

Constant inflammations keep me on

---

not the edge of my seat or something rather

near tears but on it no less perched for hurting.

That sounded like hunting, didn't it?

---

I leveled my aim months before you.

---

Place mats in back of hair seemed

the directive while a wriggle is an indicator that some

things happen when you push a button even

---

if it's just a sound of the placebo.

I say a lot of things with my mouth, man

some bougie shit comes out like raps when I'm home

alone. I made a playlist of every song in my library

---

that uses the word lonely. But the bourgeois

loneliness, that's just for poors in denial. Nobody wanted to

marry me again today. I won't keep you waiting long,

---

my love. I'll hang all your

---

pictures in the hall so I can knock them down.

The real shame here is that Shamu is a girl

in a tank top performing masculinity just

---

like me and my undercut desires. Crafts,

another way of saying to the world "I don't have

enough to do without this scrapbook" and memories

---

and table scraps. Bougie girl won't eat

---

off the floor on her hands and knees even

though the five-second rule is bullshit

too I'll call your name and request my final

---

meal. Just wieners.

Sometimes the endings are more like jokes to these

but who knows about my audience. I guess it's you

guys looking at me. How's my hair? I tried to do it

---

so it'd be suitable for the chair. Now I'm proving I can

rhyme poetics and junk it up with some clunkers

here and there. Down the rabbit

---

hole. Swallow a whole

---

bottle of pills one day at a time. Measure's

inaccurate in a curate position. I guess you see

what I did there. It was a pretty slick move.

---

Last December it took too long and I was

lonely. A little bit broke and I started

ending things with verbs. Vocables,

---

electrocutions and elocutions. Really

---

he had no idea I meant my hands when I said they

pushed me out of bed. My own want me

away from the place of consenting sometimes

---

I think again maybe I'd rather be chaired.

When I wrote this I had diarrhea

not of the brain but the real kind that comes out

your anus. I'm really slowing down on these.

---

This afternoon I went by the place

I'd dropped him

off and hoped it wouldn't make anyone else

---

as sad as I remembered being. That was it.

---

Trying to speak French turned inside

out. Out out damn spot. Parting is such

sweet sorrow. What a fucking lie,

---

right? I'm looking for some approbation here

it's okay for you to respond but please

only positive words welcome

---

because I'm sensitive.

---

Not liking the kitchen isn't a reason to leave

or not do the dishes. Living in

in in in. fuck in. fuck me in at night. What

---

am I coming to?

Everybody's moving in with their boyfriend and I

decided to get a tattoo: "ME"

all caps on my ring finger,

---

call my artist my jeweler

when I go in for touchups. Get it

sized up (cuz I'll gain weight). I'm watching

---

my figure. The way I figure it

---

I'll be that sprinter-poet. Shit.

Spinster poet. Write it all at once

like once is a place you've been and can

---

go back to it.

My boyfriend dumped me on

my birthday. I'm not bitter

---

but I am a liar.

---

Never going back there

(lie) where boys are

appealing. Fights with myself

---

always end in sex.
