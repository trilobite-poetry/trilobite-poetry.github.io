## Darnkess

for Cameron Scott
{: .forenote }

Glaucous & purely obtained from the river
{: .pad}

John Coltrane's on a languorous metal
{: .pad}

this line moves pretty fast, actually
{: .pad}

the river does not depend on you
{: .pad}

concerned with obtusity, greened pulse
{: .pad}

along thought hewn from a gone place
{: .pad}

it\'s all departure, it\'s a certain thinness
{: .pad}

behind the ontological sum of plastics
{: .pad}

so even nothing named to be caress
{: .pad}

applause for climax, a secret method
{: .pad}

fleshy underside of rosed, murky blare
{: .pad}

---

the sentences are here and working
{: .pad}

spun and chewing on meadow tempo
{: .pad}

denomination stipulates back of mind
{: .pad}

famously or unseasonably cold, a Pontiac
{: .pad}

presents an un-upheaval as brassy theory
{: .pad}

among the keyless blathers, hot mouths
{: .pad}

I liked it there, everyone's insides, rather
{: .pad}

a measure of acuteness than spacial
{: .pad}

threat on chatter, a small mention humming
{: .pad}

wide, pressing matters, psalmic heckler's
{: .pad}

leaky stripes on the derivative pale emission
{: .pad}

I liked it here, and sometimes men\'s chords
{: .pad}

go east for sake of translation\'s sane looting
{: .pad}

## Median

Pewter jawline explode white toodleoo surrogate

Bandits explain a duo of wet deer monologues

---

hovering in sunken pumpkin grove, the meandered firewall

Millenium Hilton contempo painted swoosh-of-heaven

---

Stating erect as the ballistic linens of the sun roll

Not taken by anything\'s empty miscellaneous kiosk

---

It's a gone place, frothy peppermint oil to dream

an algorithm of glowing music booked for a room

---

In my time of writing I was loving shapes of a shadow

the intermezzo was grafted to a candle outside

---

voices in debt and too broke to matter

which gave me a certain freedom tethered to a chorus

---

Congregational humiliation encumbered typical mists

quite indigo on my concern from the side of the road:

---

I don't know, maybe constant absence or

I had done it all wrong, someday it will be good

---

again, demand this of ourselves

## And Boy if I Get Drunk I Get

For Pete's sake I'm telling the music no
{: .pad}

words hide the world like something else
{: .pad}

the music is like a photograph of vapor
{: .pad}

bronchial, but chiefly granted frontier
{: .pad}

embroidered, but permission for hot riffs
{: .pad}

doubtless, but curled on pyrite lips
{: .pad}

to integrate myself into the creek\'s braids
{: .pad}

in the separate distances came the heard
{: .pad}

with space it was given cavern essence
{: .pad}

its red and sort of stylish silken flume
{: .pad}

all the gloss brightened syllable filters
{: .pad}

a figure in doorjamb thick chalcedony
{: .pad}

autodidactic repression's sung frisson

---

In all things you saw the invisible vitreous
{: .pad}

waxy opaque superstructure of capital
{: .pad}

celestial, but not without glib reason
{: .pad}

rolling breath farewell to blown increase
{: .pad}

it's a twitchy, impossible template
{: .pad}

of which no one really needs to shape
{: .pad}

stepping in to it this time, froze prisms
{: .pad}

rubbing stinky crystals in Effingham, IL
{: .pad}

as an act of god, Ryan, believe this to be
{: .pad}

truckers gliding along the dawny cumbucket
{: .pad}

median daisies swaying along Olde English

---

vanilla shadows, tonally, a crucifix, an RV
{: .pad}

*I\'m so ashamed of issuing myself plainly---*

## Saxtons River

But it doesn't matter saying what through

In memoriam stun a sun blue gun shown

the bell's hushed lash of power in heat

My chinos rolled tight, mid-crick

turning bolted schist over, that I loved

each one come loose and cloud

The microerotics of each underside

\'s discovery felt almost bad, then

darker, diligently scraping a belt of sky\'s

the mud with no windows, this guilt

or this why are the words, arriving late

now ever, my knuckles graze the afternoon

upon the pain of its briars, which cover

the wall I am building when I turn down

stream, miss, please can you point me

where a song has bent hours

*into the moon's pregnant diphthong*

## Mouthy Attempt

Everything has been thought of before but

The difficulty is to think of it again

This scale of thinking is a certain nightmare

down which the glass sprinting hallway I parallel

That this is what the light holds in tense grip

That when I arrive at the light\'s end I am house-poor

That the air this time, here, is see-thru

But I can hold its hand plainly, and begin to modify

my thoughts, issued from a thick, expired rainbow

So deep into the groove perhaps I might have been

---

> born in it, of its dandy watermelon dominion

> and anyways I hate metaphor, that bastard

> But I\'m dancing to find myself a new body

> Felt the asymmetry of its poetry tear me out

> Cover mine own heart with a tumid map violetly

> spangled with small gnomic words that shrieked

> violently "Good morning!" A small hook yanked me

> smooth, painless, like a chord, by the navel

> to a pink murmur, which was everyone\'s future

> A crocus, too, to send us good news, finally

> Exhaling the DMT on Neill\'s back porch

> in Trumansburg, seconds elapsed gothic

> I kissed time on the lips but actually, it was Adam

> What is happening and how have you been

> Maybe the people would be the times or between

## Rhinestone Salve

I would like to leave the arena continuously:

whistled & listening to the world's fizzy spittle

A rumor yourself reminiscent of y/our viscera

The field off to lunch or possibly self-destructing

Passport blue shrubs whizz ochre aire crickets

and my eyes can't discern stars commuting

fantastic cream in pockets of dirty zloty

---

Plums of occult bodega arrangements:

August\'s oblong corvids magnetize

an occidental suitcase or callow apology

used as law for art exploring our "home" "land"

Long living the gerund and kaleidoscopic passerine

memories of chromatic communisms of gerunds, too

The future\'s payroll o gavage o silvery drag

---

Thighs margin the starlit heart of the carpark:

at the denouement of the calcified zenith

fortune\'s long tongue harvests orgasm

## Lithic Analysis

Here's a golden rule I just thought of.

Metaphors've been occurring here, SAY,

prisms hung from his glans,

calves yawned in the sunflake\'s

who is this house even for

Or that this empire whittled me

to PROD the mystery

Jasper, pink on one half,

naked, with my friends

around a store-bought lake

in the midden\'s weird shadow

---

I've been doing okay despite

everything I've been doing

okay despite everything

I've been doing a little

black rock smoldering

lemon between my pupils

Despite it all being cake,

well, my JOB, knapped from

expanses of cash-only sky

I\'ve come to prove my swelling

---

as a shirt is, SAY, inevitable

a pressed collar\'s dead labor

to write around A VILLAGE

Pockets of bicentennial quarters

proof of my human verb

the SHINE of this empire's train

today's attempt to organize

an surplus of friction

*Living A Woo Pig Lifestyle*

in a small fairy circle just past

---

a pilgrim of mutter, SAY, knees

bloodied with debitage then

washed in the soft digital surf

I mean, a froth of protozoa sings

among the wilting spangled ore,

hippies dry-whistling Donovan

hot gloom and its present canopy

They can\'t see us in here---

Didn\'t sell anything today---

To make it, barely, a happiness---
