<p>I am taking the world’s loneliest jog when I happen upon the
world’s loneliest house where I spend a lifetime trimming the
world’s loneliest topiaries and collecting the world’s loneliest
crab apples in the world’s loneliest cyan pail and then I slide
down an ant hill and no longer believe in the end of days. </p>

<p>Why is the dread of being a failure the same dread as the
dread of someone seeing my nose hair in polite discussion and
proceeding to point, or worse, but maybe better, pluck, and what
if I gather everything that drifted to the ground and announce on
live television I intend to put it all back but get overwhelmed
and move to the side of a big, flat pond. </p>

<p>I laze about in fancy sweaters. </p>

<p>I figure out the game of tic-tac-toe. </p>

<p>I form a depression in the bark of a mossy log. </p>

<p>The front door is open wide one day. </p>

<p>Someone is inside taking photos on a portable device. </p>

<p><em>This is where we first met</em>, they inform me. </p>

<p>I’m shocked. </p>

<p>I walk in like I own the place even though I’m only renting.
</p>

<p>We plan on sneaking around more random buildings to look at
fire exit signs because we think we’re stuck in a parallel
universe where all the fire exits exist as blue objects but on
the way there a gorgeous breeze gets installed at ground level
and confounds us so we divert to a different place and unshell
each other’s honesty apparatus. </p>

<p>It was an idea to a build a birdbath with Jacuzzi jets. </p>

<p>We didn’t predict it would become a brand-new beach. </p>

<p>Presently, I’m shoveling sand out of the bed of a pink truck,
thinking about chair lifts and choir lofts, searching for a step
that will not disappear while on a staircase in an unfamiliar
location embraced by an orange mist rising like an audience from
the undergrowth. </p>

<p>The shadow of a puddle’s pattern on the surface of a
separate puddle. </p>

<p>A generation of saltwater, hailstone, haircut generalists.
</p>

<p>Not long after, a wood thrush is found with a Jacuzzi jet in
its beak. </p>

<p>The wood thrush lives and what happens next is it turns into a
stylish thing for birds to have Jacuzzi jets in their beaks so
gradually the Jacuzzi jets go missing. </p>

<p>The world’s loneliest ocean dries up. </p>

<p>A company is at the bottom selling ferromagnetic self-care
products. </p>

<p>The back of their shampoo bottle says <em>Shower longer and
you’re in power</em> but flip it over and there is someone
larping out of the frame like a classic heist movie I enjoyed at
home prior to my nose hair faux pas. </p>

<p>I climb onto the hardcopy balcony with the ability to grow
bone-in winglets that bond through commensalism with a wide veil
of oblong larvae ranging from files and patients to workaday
houseboat platters and weedy rockeries. </p>

<p>I paint a prototype of moving along the grass at an uneven
tempo. </p>
