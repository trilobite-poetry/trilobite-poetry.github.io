## Clearing My Throat

<div class="tradwrap">

<p>It is appealing to think of watching Steve's poem </p>

<p>reading it underneath in the Youtube field </p>

<p>for description listening to him reading something </p>

<p>else (I was falling asleep) is that really what he does </p>

<p>is he really reading? he calls it that, "perform a reading"
</p>

<p>his phrase when we were corresponding regularly </p>

<p>who can really say </p>

<hr />

<p>Each line drifts closer to an itinerary. </p>

<p>If you said "the theme of this poem is" </p>

<p>would I be impressed? you could switch </p>

<p>around the pronouns and just say </p>

<hr />

<p>Every day on Instagram I vote </p>

<p>for which shapes of pasta I prefer </p>

<p>instead of reading whatever book </p>

<p>I have open in front of me </p>

<p>who among us can say they're succeeding </p>

<p>in their reading more than me? </p>

<p>who can really say </p>

<hr />

<p>I make a PDF of Ernesto Cardenal's </p>

<p><em>Epigramas</em> for Zach after breakfast </p>

<p>and during coffee, an hour later </p>

<p>than when I---no Ernesto Cardenal </p>

<p>myself---allowed myself to be goaded </p>

<p>into an argument by a libertarian </p>

<p>on Facebook I don't know </p>

<p>the stakes were low, the payoff high </p>

<p>he ended up looking at pictures of me </p>

<p>(this also on Facebook) to help him </p>

<p>figure out how best to insult me </p>

<p>he chose my appearance! </p>

<p>which to me registers as a kind of desire </p>

<p>but who can say? </p>

<hr />

<p>Five different kinds of writing at once </p>

<p>talking makes me angry so I talk, </p>

<p>makes others anxious when I say </p>

<hr />

<p>Writing a movie in the other room </p>

<p>(piano + horns, no melody) defense </p>

<p>of writing written while talking </p>

<p>talked this writing "talking leaves reading" </p>

<p>still typing (violin and woodwind </p>

<p>still no melody) when I say </p>

<hr />

<p>The wind is being redirected by the buildings </p>

<p>the buildings are being restructured by the wind </p>

<p>I'm thinking sideways: Shelley </p>

<p>refuses to walk directly into the wind </p>

<p>which is every direction today </p>

## Tourist Trap

<div class="tradwrap">

<p>The subtitles for the film <em>Tourist Trap</em> (1979) </p>

<p>mark each silence with </p>

<p>&gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] </p>

<p>then the government decided </p>

<p>to build that new highway </p>

<p>he looks like Rutger Hauer </p>

<p>from <em>The Hitcher</em> (1986) with a hat like </p>

<p>John Turturro in <em>The Secret Window</em> </p>

<p>(2004) &gt;&gt;[BLANK_AUDIO] </p>

<p>and we're supposed to believe he's </p>

<p>a law student? with arms like that? </p>

<p>there's a third man </p>

<p>as in Carol Reed's <em>The Third Man</em> (1949) </p>

<p>only no one will be Orson Welles </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;[BLANK_AUDIO] </p>

<p>yesterday was the first day of spring </p>

<p>today it snowed, the phone doesn't work </p>

<p>but neither do I! everything </p>

<p>sharpens as I think about it more </p>

<p>a kind of </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;[BLANK_AUDIO] </p>

<p>(but the subtitles don't indicate the fauna </p>

<p>of the rural US south at night </p>

<p>the swelling of the score to indicate </p>

<p>danger/horror) </p>

<p>books keep </p>

<p>piling up on the windowsills </p>

<p>I pile books on the windowsills </p>

<p>which is only an intention to </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;[BLANK_AUDIO] </p>

<p>[INAUDIBLE] </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;[SOUND] </p>

<p>he should let me go to the city </p>
