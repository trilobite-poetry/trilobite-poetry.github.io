## Inside From Out

have&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;tendriling inside&nbsp;&nbsp;as Ivy&nbsp;&nbsp;presenting

---

but black lamprey eel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teeth and suckers

---

snake&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weed-like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grow fast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up on crawling

---

our walls&nbsp;&nbsp;felt&nbsp;&nbsp;steel bonded&nbsp;&nbsp;united&nbsp;&nbsp;deep

---

moated&nbsp;&nbsp;now find&nbsp;&nbsp;pink spun&nbsp;&nbsp;sugar&nbsp;&nbsp;mere

---

artifice&nbsp;&nbsp;horror&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;torn scab off&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our cover

---

invaders&nbsp;&nbsp;infesting&nbsp;&nbsp;minute
cracks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in base

---

as our
home's&nbsp;&nbsp;epidermis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in-burrow&nbsp;&nbsp;like

---

termites&nbsp;&nbsp;spread&nbsp;&nbsp;vein-like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on feeding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on

---


starch of&nbsp;&nbsp;our courage both&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shredding&nbsp;&nbsp;on

---

ligaments&nbsp;&nbsp;steel destroy&nbsp;&nbsp;safety
pins&nbsp;&nbsp;thrown

---

up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold walls&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;see bared&nbsp;&nbsp;mortar&nbsp;&nbsp;both

---


deeper look&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both own&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flaws break&nbsp;&nbsp;to

---


restructure&nbsp;&nbsp;to remedy&nbsp;&nbsp;bond fix&nbsp;&nbsp;build back

---

us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be stronger&nbsp;&nbsp;what&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;en-frenzied

---


inciting&nbsp;&nbsp;it's
eating&nbsp;&nbsp;wound&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near into

---

salacious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slurping&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;death throes

---


voracious&nbsp;&nbsp;stop&nbsp;&nbsp;harm can
save&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;figure

---

stop&nbsp;&nbsp;it
us&nbsp;&nbsp;wait&nbsp;&nbsp;can't&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bear

---

---

leftover nothing but

---


broken piled&nbsp;&nbsp;memory

---


---


left us with

---

have nothing

---



---

now -- 

---

rent a

in this of my age It's a comfort to me It's

embracing not blacking out past or defacing authorities laws and
the order It's there and so easy to watch on tv or to read on the
screen how It's clear how they're wrong telling we stole the land
or we aren't fair to some or we need to love foreigners even
though knowing most live high on handouts we give 'em we pay for
It's telling what's clear and It's getting us back to the battle
of hymn where we wage against evil and strangers bad morals
besides It's a sin to go breaking out windows or hurt good
traditions break statues break laws they're all losers the
enemies here and we're righteous It's clear and It's palatable
simple swallow and best It's within easy reach

## Urban Boy-Child Palimset

Instructions:

---

Firstly,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*if* can salvage, *if* -- 

scrape all off&nbsp;&nbsp;as to resmoothe

(no, you needn't read what's there

writ last be rst

be-damned, Original)

these kid skins' quite susceptible

drinking deep first ink

Our cleanse requires cash for us -- 

---


and Master patience

(and huge sticks)

Results: grown years later

---

***Your*** chosen "expert fixer"

used a tincture made of gall

too destructive method -- it turns out...

---



---

but every us has&nbsp;&nbsp;limits
{:style="text-indent:6rem;"}

*plus*, their&nbsp;&nbsp;code was carved in skin
{:style="text-indent:4rem;"}

... whole manuscript ***was*** garbage,
{:style="text-indent:4rem;"}

after all
