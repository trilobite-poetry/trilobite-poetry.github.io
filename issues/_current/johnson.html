<h2 id="also-and-too">Also and Too</h2>
<p>1</p>
<hr />
<p>Leave nothing undone, risk finding yourself</p>
<p>answerable for disorder ! When I say that is being</p>
<hr style="margin:2rem 0;" />
<p>capacious, like a great river, and say also, or</p>
<hr style="margin:2rem 0;" />
<p>maybe something like the opposite like</p>
<p>being perceived</p>
<p>minutely as one for whom</p>
<p>food, yes, is pleasant but whose</p>
<p>desire for knowledge</p>
<hr style="margin:2rem 0;" />
<p>of evil</p>
<p>makes laziness impossible, you</p>
<hr style="margin:3rem 0;" />
<p>add - <em>we made a deal</em> - Some</p>
<p>find it in music</p>
<hr />
<p>if they are usually doing it, while</p>
<p>others are liable to seize upon &mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>are made happy by mittens</p>
<p>nine out of ten, mittens</p>
<p>and why not, I love mine.</p>
<p>I love mine too.</p>
<hr />
<p>2</p>
<hr />
<p>They say</p>
<p>means of gratification are many</p>
<p><em>if you’ve been forewarned</em></p>
<p>every moment past</p>
<p>-keep ’em coming- will</p>
<hr />
<p>be followed by pain.</p>
<p>“They” is clearly the voice of self-love</p>
<p>of course it is - the light that, climbing</p>
<hr />
<p>sap-like inside a tree up</p>
<p>to the top seems</p>
<hr />
<p>valuable, of value, when <em>you</em></p>
<p>are stationed there, too –</p>
<p>“light,” another name for</p>
<p>that various power whose loss</p>
<p>you were forewarned against.</p>
<p>O sensitive parrot aware you</p>
<p>never encountered language</p>
<hr />
<p>3</p>
<hr />
<p>Does pain affect mind ? Let</p>
<p>a beast look around a</p>
<p>degree of folly</p>
<hr />
<p>is of trifling consequence except when</p>
<p>supercharged by the misery to which</p>
<hr />
<p>a beast is exposed acting</p>
<p>on this short life. Then, the folly</p>
<p>does it a wickedness,</p>
<p><em>there is one emotion. Well</em></p>
<hr />
<p>much that is alarming binds us</p>
<p>to this life but also, happily,</p>
<p>rivets, nothing, drunkenness</p>
<p>do too !</p>
<h2 id="a-effort">A Effort</h2>
<p>1</p>
<hr />
<p>Why not warn me</p>
<p>I am holding my one fish</p>
<p>tangible reward of thrift</p>
<p>incautiously too near the fire ?</p>
<p>You are thinking you’re young</p>
<p>who doesn’t love a <em>youthful crime</em></p>
<p>do wrong and return to virtue later</p>
<hr />
<p>but – you are old, mind wisely gone,</p>
<p>my farmed fish a coal a bit</p>
<p>excited by the injury done it</p>
<p>after death before</p>
<hr />
<p>dinner. Always die poor !</p>
<p>The glorious view</p>
<p>up here, at last</p>
<p>not a fall risk.</p>
<hr />
<p>2</p>
<hr />
<p>In every <em>classic</em> age</p>
<p>a effort suffices to win</p>
<p>the spoils of sundry triumphs</p>
<p>minus remorse,</p>
<p>a plus. Not now. In</p>
<p><em>this period</em> THE duty’s been</p>
<p>“research clade</p>
<hr />
<p>of selves.”</p>
<p>Yet hope applies its own odd force,</p>
<p><em>doubt whether modern physician…</em></p>
<p><em>I will fall from a precipice ?</em></p>
<p>Anyway, was it ever, when ??</p>
<p><em>vain</em> to hope one’s tiny, best</p>
<p>failures might be remembered ?</p>
<p>Not even in classic ages !</p>
<hr />
<p>3</p>
<hr />
<p>This lobby seems</p>
<hr />
<p>the</p>
<hr />
<p>place for a horse</p>
<hr />
<p>to sleep but stay, Sleep ! Mental balance,</p>
<hr />
<p>horse, is inconsistent with</p>
<hr />
<p>relief. So I am not</p>
<hr />
<p>a rider. You are</p>
<hr />
<p>not weary. Why mercy, then – if mercy we</p>
<hr />
<p>admit we suffer and our work suffers,</p>
<hr />
<p>we suffer, our work suffers – and see</p>
<hr />
<p>every little thwarted thing ride us</p>
<hr />
<p>out into water…</p>
<h2 id="deserving-nature">Deserving Nature</h2>
<p>1</p>
<hr />
<p>Few arguments</p>
<p>for deserving nature</p>
<hr style="margin:2rem 0;" />
<p>in its local form surpass</p>
<p><em>When the day,</em></p>
<hr style="margin:3rem 0;" />
<p><em>hunting approbation, begins</em></p>
<hr style="margin:4rem 0;" />
<p><em>before other days,</em></p>
<p><em>I forgive it.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>2</p>
<hr />
<p>Having</p>
<p>practiced</p>
<hr />
<p>and practiced</p>
<p>gregariousness till</p>
<hr />
<p>you like your fellow men</p>
<p>as they are – your failure then</p>
<p>complete and final – <em>being</em></p>
<p><em>itself</em> puts you within</p>
<hr />
<p>reach of a muscular,</p>
<p>pleasing failure</p>
<p>health.</p>
<hr />
<p>3</p>
<hr />
<p>Don’t negotiate</p>
<p>it away, glory</p>
<hr style="margin:3rem 0;" />
<p>in the brand which</p>
<p>marks you for a villain that velocity,</p>
<p>if you</p>
<p>leave every other being unmolested</p>
<p>as during your infancy</p>
<hr />
<p>well, I have often been amazed at the lack</p>
<p>of bygones - put plainly, of a</p>
<hr />
<p>past - amongst those who left every</p>
<p>other being unmolested. Not</p>
<p>surviving is</p>
<p>as disgraceful as a nation.</p>
<p>Above, some absurdities</p>
<hr />
<p>not unlike the beauty of a chin.</p>
<hr />
<p>4</p>
<hr />
<p>Labor to cherish as tender</p>
<p>anything labor</p>
<hr />
<p>can tenderize ! stuff</p>
<p>preciouser than toast</p>
<hr />
<p>say, <em>doubt</em> – as for that, act</p>
<p>as if doubt had secured by</p>
<p>indirectly forbidden means</p>
<hr />
<p>the right to prevent its own destruction.</p>
<p>Go</p>
<p>doubt you’re asleep, that</p>
<p>morning will come, that</p>
<p>it’s come, that it</p>
<hr />
<p>hasn’t <em>come</em></p>
<p><em>for you</em>. Doubt a</p>
<p>statement of purposelessness really a feint</p>
<p>mentioning tender green fields, animals, air, can</p>
<p>repel false honor, bad support,</p>
<p>wrong education, INTERESTED nurture, plus also</p>
<p>the forcible prohibition of discussion</p>
<p>of misery, the object and tendency</p>
<hr />
<p>of which is to promote</p>
<p>misery.</p>
