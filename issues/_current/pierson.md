<p style="padding-left:4rem;">&lt;thru the mesh of nacreous periphery so I find myself</p>
<p>in the kitbashed scale model beside shards infinitesimally</p>
<p style="padding-left:4rem;">mirrored, regress given recent events which unstitch</p>
<p>a fixed continuous, removed for speculation. Isn’t it nice this</p>
<p style="padding-left:4rem;">cider in these weeds. My physick shiver hiss on the swivel</p>
<p>everyday barely begun clapped out filt’ring the blurt of an any-day</p>
<p style="padding-left:4rem;">-nowist flies on the wall thru the quire they diversify&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-top:1rem;padding-top:1rem;border-top:1px solid black;">&lt;our demise. You watch from behind glass acronymic harmonies</p>
<p style="padding-left:4rem;">it’s like I said they said the grid permits you dissolution compleat</p>

<p style="padding-left:4rem;">afeared to say aloud, all of a peace. Spaceless, gone are the houses</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;padding-bottom:1rem;border-bottom:1px solid black;">and in consuming another, it too is consumed. O hideous louses&gt;</p>
<p style="padding-left:4rem;">&lt;on the fourth of the shortest day of the year it was nearly June</p>
<p>collapsed. A language flayed from memory at the speed</p>
<p style="padding-left:4rem;">of around half the national average. Uh oh, it looks like you</p>
<p>‘ve taken the road hardest travelled, kudos for the picture</p>
<p style="padding-left:4rem;">of burning, the pet nat you have to pay for you’ve opened</p>
<p>the box you weren’t meant to. We were thoughtless in the tureen be</p>
<p style="padding-left:4rem;">-guiled as a whole family drunk, heaven into the grotesque cloud&gt;</p>
