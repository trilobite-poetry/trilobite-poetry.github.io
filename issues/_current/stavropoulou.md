Before all else my greetings to all poets, dead or alive.

---

My dead (standing firmly behind me) perpetually sing my name:

---

*in ortu sanguinis per peregrinationem casus ade elementa
surceperunt gaudia in te*.

---

It’s the living that can’t stop haunting me. They seem deader
than the dead. The dead feed me.

---

Do you think this has grown as some sort of natural psychic
mutation of the age?

---

Perhaps it has something to do with being in the mountains, or
the wine of my own voice.

---

I belong to Shiva.

---

I looked inside my body for my soul. I only found the
blue-throated one.

---

There was no soul.

---

A slave of extremes, I'm both dead and alive: I have no need to

extract the stone of madness.

---

One can't be crazy enough. I'm both Eurydice and Orpheus. I'm
perpetually giving birth. My 

body is *schrecklich*. In fact "the" body is *schrecklich*.

---

All bodies are *schrecklich*.

---

Thinking about this body something curiously effervescent where

good and evil reunite, absorbs me. I'm a microbe dwelling on a
microbe orbiting a microbe.

---

Language is the final frontier.

---

Yet like birds in need of a branch to land on, words need our
flesh
