## Soft Hurricane

my best friend      
Facetimes while shaving      
her armpits and tells      
of how an elder      
in her Ojibwe tribe      
warned against      
the vulnerability      
of parenting--      
i wonder the shield      
in my ribcage      
the sword at my      
throat the kisses      
endlessly planted      
in the pale apple      
bow of my daughter's      
sweet pink cheek--      
the repetitiousness      
of my need for her.      
now it's humid      
in Los Angeles      
like never and beyond      
the baby blue wall a phone      
synchronizes emergency      
warnings--- it doesn't      
stir but instead      
soothes, somehow--      
is this why my mother      
flies to Hawaii'i      
to help put out the flames?      
why she drives door to door      
during a southern flood?      
the suffering of others      
is easier to assist--      
i note her fallopian      
program baiting me      
*don't fight it*      
metal under the tongue tensing      
muscle against an upward      
tilting of the day--      
just serve      
those who need serving--      
it seems simple      
but i don't chew      
like a saint      
and my mouth      
is it's own shape      
and as i teeter slopes      
of burying more      
seeds in my uterus      
thinking it's a good idea      
like last spring   
planting morning glories   
that now choke   
pink passion flowers   
pushing up through the rain--    
as i fuss that slow   
swell that soft   
hurricane within   
which could, i admit   
kill me--    
something loosens   
unclenches, gives way.   
perhaps there will always   
be more to give      
perhaps      
it doesn't matter      
what it costs      
   
## Lost Clock
   
the common things   
i crave one could   
spread butter over   
or salt, or soak   
in hot water   
long enough to get   
forgotten. they are   
so simple and smooth   
one could lick and lick and lick   
until full.   
if i bow to towers   
of dirty dishes slick   
with toddler delights   
maybe peace   
would shed shirtsleeves   
from her sweet shoulders   
and awe would slow me--    
maybe in her perfect   
presence my need   
would unwind   
like a held in sigh   
and the things i loved   
would rediscover   
bones at my feet   
and hands and   
the tomatoes   
in my ramshackle   
greenhouse would   
shed their green faces   
and go soft--    
and when the one   
without my face   
plucks and places   
a yellow cherry   
between her back teeth   
scrunching her eyebrows   
and bites   
i would see the rosy flesh   
of the one who ran   
and know how   
to say it gently--    
that relief i was given.   
the blessing of fleeing   
the blessing of fear   
staring me down   
every morning demanding   
cereal and applesauce   
is a revelation:   
how unnecessary   
someone is to fully love   
someone else.   
they are eyes   
that can't make up their mind   
green and gray   
brown and red--   
*she's finally looking like you*   
her aunt said at a party   
face to face   
olives and sweet cream   
at bedtime: tiny hands   
reaching up through the dark   
a little lost clock whispering   
*one more mama*   
no negotiations   
no bribes   
we just lie there   
let our vocal folds   
become tender   
buckle the bend   
in our chests   
watch everything ripen   
and go translucent   
the moon so close   
and white
