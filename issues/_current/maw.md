## Log Thought 

stuck in the thicket, remote country
{: .indent2}

---

metamorphic coffins, I miss the palm 
{: .indent2}

---

pinwheel move, eating fire
{: .indent2}

---

yawn explosion, I swipe away the muck
{: .indent2}

---

---

---

*surcease, fronds*
{: .indent3}

## Log Thought

atop crown 
{: .indent1}

---

head dread
{: .indent1}

---

brain chain
{: .indent1}

---

---

I wear a gray cape

---

---

listen to 45 Grave

---

suck on a medicine pop

---

---

jaw clench 
{: .indent1}

---

neck wrench
{: .indent1}

---

fall back to bed
{: .indent1}

---

*grave, sliver*
{: .indent4}

## Log Thought

the legalese was meant to confuse
{: .indent1}

hereby&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereby&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therein
{: .indent1}

I named the country *Passionland*
{: .indent1}

---

---

*cabinet, frost*
{: .indent4}
