## Read to Kill

Based on contraband, based on stealing fire, based on the thrill
of nothingness I could consider paying taxes –– if reading is all
you want and maybe a little tidying up. But as it is each night a
new piece of shit falls from the hole in the sky. The vast arms
that encircle us with their discontinuities remain unable to
reach me aside from the occasional caress.

Fragments of fragments, one must recreate oneself in the image of
conscious activity. When I leave this town, I'm stealing your
bike-rack and putting my broken one through your windshield. It's
like I told the cops, when I'm reading don't fucking talk to me.

## Against the Outdoors

I deny utterly the reading, writing, and the comprehension of
poetry outside. Poetry has nothing to do with the outside. As
soon as you go outside you are in the Western Tradition. The
Western Box. Any supposedly fresh take or development of that
ground is instantly and obviously tainted by its underlying
materialism. (Materialism [or Positivism] is that concrete
relationship to the world which supports the sciences, and does
not have anything to do with the material world, much as its
conclusions may impact it.) Isn't it curious that those who
envision a 're-wilding' of men and women also insist on deep
draughts of the outdoors. If I am ever outdoors, and I do not say
that I am, have been, or will be –– I will be certain to have
first assumed the spiritual grandeur of that primordial being who
in the Vedas is named Ka, or "Who", and from whom all creation is
at various times given birth, to the surprise and resignation of
all parties.

## James Dean as Amelia Earheart

<div class="poem">
<p>No one can pretend to be who they are</p>
<p>for even the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>It unfolds an extreme verity</p>
<p>to run with that herd of mice</p>
<p>down the slopes of sleep</p>
<p>with the dancing horses</p>
<p>that trampled their riders</p>
<p>I can't wait to see the faces</p>
<p>on the cake girls' faces</p>
<p>once a setting is prepared</p>
<p>and the cats can crawl forward.</p>
<hr />
<p>Whenever someone dies</p>
<p>me and my ghoul gang will be there</p>
<p>watching the pornography of their things</p>
<p>groping with crawfish in the lazy river</p>
<p>of what praxis voids.</p>
<hr />
<p>People with no taboo against drowning.</p>
<p>People without advice. Erogenous zones</p>
<hr />
<p>impossible to perceive as genuine.</p>
<p>The phantom of the opera. The phantom of</p>
<p>architecture. The phantom of the body endures</p>
<p>the body's catcalls. Along the catwalks they discuss my fate</p>
<p>rich with oxygen and unscaled drawings</p>
<p>that are a lorgnette against my ruin</p>
<hr />
<p>the better to impress longshoremen,</p>
<p>with intense ease that seasons the grass.</p>
<p>I'm having a brain attack just trying to reach you ––</p>
<hr />
<p>a fulfillment unheard of around here is absolutely turning heads,</p>
<p>and not necessarily in a good way, either.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's the experimental reverence of the blind.</p>
<p>It's the magic mushroom, or whatever.</p>
<p>It's James Dean playing Amelia Earheart</p>
<p>after her crash in Madagascar,</p>
<hr />
<p>to say: we will rise from the dead and the gas stations</p>
<p>that mark the three days of absence</p>
<p>will become as insignificant as the earth.</p>
<p>For everything is yet to be built,</p>
<p>and lo the wind is whistling between one thing and another.</p>
