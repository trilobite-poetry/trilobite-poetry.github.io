## year zero: faciality

*i. tree: life, roots and crown*

---

motion may be eliminated but its introduction nevertheless

drives the belief that merely

recognizing the program of the unforeseen

makes time useless again.

---

put yourself at the interval of the interval. divide therefore

your own science and isolate the same.

---

how can actuality be produced?

---

the operative cytoplasm, the centrosome

attract too the broken and original forms.

---

two fresh constructed lines and the least

of these operations attract some sugar, some oil.

---

being of matter, what is gained is reconstructed

even in its organic and vital activity.

---

unite and deny to an arrangement

the irreversibility of your ignorance.

---

we only grow old. our loss is certain.

---

only the discontinuity of the living is the same.

only the embryo and all its programmed inevitabilities.

---

*ii. fish: richness, the unknown*

---

excrescence. a bud endeavors

to continue the continuous

and we feel like we live. there is no

dazzling prospect, only necessity.

---

the going from atoms to something to

nothing of calculation.

---

touch destruction. our evolutionary phenomenon

will not in any way be said

to be progress. all these short intervals

---

on which we fix our attention

embrace in this same body of the universe.

---

we form agreed on schemas of this, the entire world

as the result of the mutually produced

authority of experience by which

the vital action, the continuous generation

---

is falsely implied.

## introduction: rhizome

*i. flowers: present, creativity*

---

a curve so small it is part

of a tangent, a point

he will consider. that is to say

---

a number, but only that.

he is always reborn

as if it were nothing more

than inhalation, repetition.

---

old elements repeat to foretell phenomena

the explanations of which are easier in glass.

---

that which imparts elements

is that which is meant to say

properly speaking, there is no impartial.

---

all is viewed from end to end. all is construed

as photographs, as the physiochemical endeavor

to reduce phenomena. we can be

---

certain of others, like those between

two partitions who would create

---

little organisms. how

can they actually be produced?

---

*ii. book: secret, unknown*

---

the entire world is the result of mutual biology

of the mathematics of the physics of the mathematics

lost in the mass of some ancient geometry.

---

reject our radical finalism. the doctrine

of our teleology, of this world

as outward appearance of excrescence.

---

the buds endeavor to continue the continuous

by which vital action the continuity

of the generated is implied. if we were not to be

---

of matter what would be gained? nothing

would be past, would be present. we could

imagine ourselves at no point, represented only

---

by an immense system of simultaneity.

motion could be eliminated, but this introduction

is nevertheless in belief that if necessary

---

we could turn back from atoms

to nothing.
