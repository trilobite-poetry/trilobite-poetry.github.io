<h2>DAWNEDOWNED</h2>
<p>Hopper ate the pies with marmelade. A hope operating on a plate,
undissolving distance,</p>
<p>a fading magenta and the dissipated blue. My shoulders and my thighs
that tighten and</p>
<p>widen with the conversation at its unease. Release! One street
further:</p>
<p>my best friend. Nothing out of the ordinary, just the screaming
bivalves</p>
<p>in the mouth, then deep into the throat, the perfect permanence
in</p>
<p>the tight order of a procession. Crack the sound inside me —</p>
<p>I tell him, while he is mesmerized by his own thoughts,</p>
<p>coffee — at this undecent hour our bodies should</p>
<p>touch, down, beneath the ice sheets. “Operation Sunshine”, Hopper
eaten on a plate with</p>
<p>some marmelade. “All your plain ol’ sweetness, of the rape flowers, a
seeding of</p>
<p>the imperfection you are searching for in the nowhere,
undetectable.</p>
<p>The hormonal fluctuation in the disowned: “you aren’t mine,</p>
<p>and we are no longer”. The canvas strips itself from</p>
<p>any meaning. Cracking layers of crepuscular</p>
<p>bodies unthought. A specific submarine</p>
<p>under the specific sheet — ice-glazed paper and the smell of bubble
gum and cotton</p>
<p>candy and marshmallows. I am in your pocket, rummaging around for the
meaning.</p>
<p>You are keen on syntax, so syntactic pleasures aren’t excluded from
the dic-</p>
<p>tionary you often open, but you would never think about tearing
me</p>
<p>into pieces, as I would do with your thesaurus. You remind me of:</p>
<p>people, random poets, a poking object in the destitute space,</p>
<p>a word order in a disordered world, our views, off-topic,</p>
<p>the kindle version of your own, some blond jokes,</p>
<p>I am kidding your away, pulling the strings —</p>
<p>Miles off my coast, a steelhead, a tin soldier</p>
<p>plundering the waist coat threwn on the heap of rubbish, taming
kangoroos with a</p>
<p>sweet Southern Italian accent. The dialectic behaviorism of the
dyslectic disc,</p>
<p>turning between the bone, the essicated nerve endings and the
cartilage —</p>
<p>you are in a capsule travelling unease. In the corner of the room</p>
<p>a toy submarine radiates the glow I measure — in your face,</p>
<p>mine with the highest albedo, to suck in the most light.</p>
<p>In the QED vacuum, your particles hop into and out of existance, my
black body</p>
<p>photons dissimulating the simulation, or the carbon particles stuck
in the ice</p>
<p>sheet, I heat up. You are a magnetic monopole. Our triangle shines
with</p>
<p>the force of the frying sun. The cliff hanger is being mangled,</p>
<p>by the putting off of the reciever. Our phones are talkative,</p>
<p>in and by themselves. The resident permit I shove</p>
<p>under the phone, under the door of a hotel room where you stay, and I
photograph</p>
<p>myself close to a phonograph, I am amusing like music that flows in
and out</p>
<p>of our discreet inertia. You put your hat on, I switch off the heat,
and this</p>
<p>unwelcome space could just as well mean a nerve ending and</p>
<p>a new beginning, while we travel under this sheet of ice,</p>
<p>maneuvering the submarine without a compass.</p>
<p>No compassion behind the untamed eyes</p>
<p>of a frog, evolving, splashing into a puddle where he/she is stuck.
“You could as well</p>
<p>capitulate” — I hear his distance voice which is oblong and
obstacled,</p>
<p>his maundering smile in a machine, with the rusty cog wheels,</p>
<p>examining your equipment as if it wasn’t part of. You and</p>
<p>me, a floundering couple in this Minute Maid juice —</p>
<p>with a smile ajar, develop smiles to ease the system;</p>
<p>our minds in overdrive and out of control, yet well guided</p>
<p>through a speech about the freedom of thought,</p>
<p>and expression — we are writers. So rigidly</p>
<p>and clumsily trying not to crash into the North Pole from beneath,
during the operation,</p>
<p>which most probably will be a succession of failed flails within,
rusty gears and</p>
<p>a submarine’s decaying body, well-aligned with the Black Sea
shore,</p>
<p>when it is put at rest with the sunshine flickering on its
surface.</p>
<p>This is our clearing, where we have almost steered clear</p>
<p>of this steep mountain ridge, where we will die</p>
<p>unattended on the Hillary step. It is impossible</p>
<p>to detect a man dying in such a distance — now that we are in the
Death Zone,</p>
<p>“like a giant fish when it has just been hauled from the sea after a
terrific struggle”.</p>
<p>Your lips are rock holds, and I get a grasp of them, although I can’t
hold them,</p>
<p>as the north face crumbles. Devoid of our dying, distant
creatures</p>
<p>of the Big Blue, diving within, perfectly able to deal with</p>
<p>the underwater pressure — skiing down from the mountain,</p>
<p>straight into the Sea, a body of water tepid enough to ease</p>
<p>the mourning sunshine of our radioactive fall out.</p>
<p>You spread, and I become green —</p>
<p>and evergreen; a glow forever. The cornice and the rock. Bluff. Such
a precipice,</p>
<p>to which I don’t own the recipe, so that I put you in a shaker and am
shaking</p>
<p>you till you would become a cocktail. By the swimming pool good
girls</p>
<p>show us there swaying edges, as cloths will fall down into a</p>
<p>deeper dawn and dusk, in order to commemorate</p>
<p>the thoughts wasted, in the ethylious vapour.</p>
<p>“We can wrap it up” — you state, and</p>
<p>I couldn’t have agreed more on allowing you a fade-out of my own
attachment</p>
<p>to the last line. The last line that will commemorate the future, yet
to be</p>
<p>handed over to the coming generation of the individualists’ no
ones.</p>
<p>Full and continuous, I repeat, and I wrap you in a titanium
sheet,</p>
<p>and munch on fools’ gold, as another morning with its great</p>
<p>calm arouses me with its calmness, telling me that</p>
<p>there is still time to become. My unthoughts</p>
<p>are the manifolds in this balance vaccuum —</p>
<p>regardless the matter, I unfeel.</p>
<p>The bedsheets on the shelves</p>
<p>look at me, and I see an elf circling, my circulatory system is in
homeostasis —</p>
<p>as the spies of the day devolve on the virgin snow, with the
excruciating</p>
<p>light that increases on the sheet of paper, Blinding Lights —</p>
<p>and a witch’s edges well-maintained with WD-40.</p>
<p>Don’t write God’s name on the paper.</p>
<p>Put some suncream — grapeseed</p>
<p>aromas mixing with the bitter smell of the grape leaves — and I write
his name</p>
<p>sevenfold as I unwhirl my smile of the eternally white knowledge of
the now,</p>
<p>still happening. Then, I repeat the operation, and feign as if
nothing had</p>
<p>ever happened.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">MAINTENANCE</h2>
<p class="prose-block">
The commercial value of the momentous cover he covered himself with,
divided him into two entities, I won’t name. The screws in the lamellae
in the flagellation, as a dismal distance had illuminated his aluminium
face. The onions, part of the story, had dissolved into pixels. He stood
there with his face chopped, kiss-dissolve, cross-kiss, kissdistance. He
had made his importune fatigue into an octopus’ tentacles touching on my
disbelief of future knowledge. He was one, chopped by his oneness,
further devolving into the machine he had created.
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
He, or a lumiferous ether, calling himself the anti-God of the
centuries, yet to digress into a more or less opportune creation, where
the creature transcends its creator. We lighted no candles, or we no
longer lighted the candles, but switched on our speakers, says Steiner,
and as the unpoetic was non-apologetic, dissolving into a much more
natural metric, turning into a brabble: the pop culture had gotten into
me. Kiss crash. Michael was sitting on the bottom line of this map, and
when I was looking for him, he wasn’t even there, so I practically had
no other option than to fall in love with his absence.
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
The subject of my love got further compressed, the more I have detected
his absence, and the more I fell for this nothingness, in a masochistic
trait, becoming a habit. How can one love so much the ‘nothing’?
Michael, you, or I, we was/were developing or de-evolving ourselves into
faceless entities, on a crumbling time-line, yet to be drawn, on which
the graphic of the seismograph was writing the graphic in real-time. The
continental plates weren’t more restless than the society which sticks
out between 54.6 cm to 272 cm from the Earth – the tallest and the
shortest human beings – but can we actually detect absence with a
quantifying it, hence death, hence living?
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
I apply a shortcut and the person is either deceased or deceived. I look
at him through a gadget’s screen, where he still is, until the very
moment when the connection will be broken. You can hang up on the
matter, and closing a conversation is a similar case. Switching off
one’s thoughts is more difficult. Being in love with someone’s absence
is literary bullshit. Yet, the man I love most has never yet manifested
himself to me in real life. Now that I can create “the perfect man” for
me, I can even disregard this thought, and create my male equivalent,
whom I would love the most of any. I will be falling apart in a
slice-glitch kind of representation, if I would want my own
disintegration, at least in the digital space.
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
I can cut myself into pieces. So, the species that are evolving had made
the machine the lengthening of themselves, in order to reach other
possible heights, or: heightened realities, still implemented into human
history. Just like the female sitting over me has just put on her
glasses. We are capable to have protrusions, either flesh or machine.
The machine can read into Broca’s area, a machine learning mechanism can
visualize my thoughts in language through the electrodes attached to the
right neurons inside the brain, on the cortex. Soon, mortality won’t
necessarily take place, intellect uploaded in the cloud. So, what does
my operation to un-be and un-think myself and to investigate nothing
could result in?
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
Can I send you my submission of a blank page, where the absolute silence
would regain its territory – can I tell you that my spiritual journey
and my linguistic journey aren’t that likely to merge, as I have been
thinking throughout the years? My career, the content-carrier, and the
unloaded freight train, and the loaded freight ship shan’t be considered
by anything else but its load. But am I, intelligible, through the blank
page, would be so eager to submit – as an answer to your question, and
all the questions alike?
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
How dissatisfactory are we with the absolute starting point: ‘nothing’,
which is not even a point, or a temporal escape from the knowledge we
earn by finding the ultimate metaphor, for all of us, people, finally
exiting the stage, dissolving into not even absence but pure
nothingness? Inexistence. Where all the isms will melt like gyzm, the
only ‘self-contained force’, triggering the female egg, and the host’s
body, to carry the promise of a human life we can abort? As life doesn’t
speak for itself no longer, human might as well become as much
‘unspoken’, ‘untold’. To be exact: the complete silence will be the
compressed nothing of each line, each word spoken, to be-come un-spoken.
The object line can be left empty.
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
Although I can’t send a mail to a non-object, unless it is someone who
is dead, I can still displace my message. It is impossibly done with an
email. I need an address to be able to send a message, but I oddly don’t
need an addressee when I scribble a writing on the paper. Do I? Am I
supposed to be read, and are you supposed to read me? How could all this
information get lost, without being undone? The scrolls are rolling on
the floor, and I am rolling on top of them. My body is becoming text, as
I unfold in the physical space taken up and dirtied by the letters. I
want to un-be me. I have no other choices left to finally get rid of
myself.
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
If not in the name of love, where two identities merge, and in so doing,
my identity could dissolve in the other person. Maybe, love is the last
old fashioned straw, which we can hardly hold onto still, hanging in our
struggle for survival in this mainly stochastically arranged system.
Life is devoid of logic. Life lacks coherence. Writing lacks coherence.
Love is at least aiming for coherence. But we cross-dissolve into each
other like two slides, as two mirrors being shifted over each other,
without our surfaces touching. “Keep surfing, and enjoy your holidays”,
I read this on the imaginary postcard my mind just has sent me.
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
Nothing is impossible, but some thoughts are more improbable than the
nothingness I was referring to. Why the words virgin and white and light
communicate the same ‘spotless’ quality, if it wasn’t our purpose to get
back to the empty? Maybe, the empty is the only space we can fill up,
and if we miss out on our chances to have any silence, vacuum, we could
have impossibly existed. Nothing is the only ‘split’ where something can
begin and end, almost simultaneously, and there must be a moment in
time, where there is truly something like nothing. We will always have a
difficulty to perceive such a thing as nothingness.
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
So, instead of providing you with the empty document, I will send you
this writing – so that it could be torn into pieces, so that there will
be something I put out there to experience further decay. Maybe, I
should just advance in the opposite direction, and oblige myself to get
back on the spiritual path undertaken, get back from experiencing the
wholeness, within a fragmented shape, that is: I must re-become text and
thought? Can a rebirth be so painful, whereas the mind and the conscious
had already taken the leap-of-faith, so irreversible?
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
What if I have already unbeen? What if I was already unthought? And what
if, re-appearing in text would no further define the shape I exist in?
What if our self-worths weren’t dependent on the shapes we take and the
functions we hold? Could we evolve from these robotic and utilitarian
human beings, into something which is more than the machine? Are there
such things as feelings? Or shall we go on, pondering, what is our right
to exist? Why we even should?
</p>
<p class="prose-block">
<h2 id="crossthissoul">CROSSTHISSOUL</h2>
<p>Shout the letter! scream screen, and as the scientists had
established earlier, use a sun screen.</p>
<p>Bettering my uninvolvement I revolt the revolver in the hand. I am
going to dissolve</p>
<p>into this crying thing on the touchscreen, waiting for your fingers
to touch</p>
<p>the screen of the gadget.</p>
<p>Unreal as a being can be, you are.Unreal as a being can become, I am.
The heartbeat is</p>
<p>one of those things, I can’t hear in our talking –</p>
<p>through the body I evolve, and through the body of him I could be</p>
<p>what I most inherently am. Messing with realities, identities,</p>
<p>I am being further tortured into this future, I consider</p>
<p>as non-future. A crying glitch, a scarred face. You couldn’t even
behead me,</p>
<p>even if you wanted to, in such a distance. What you are now, is what
you truly aren’t;</p>
<p>I pick up some fragments and get back to reality, which is as surreal
as I am missing</p>
<p>a concrete block to stand on.</p>
<p>Lacking a place, being in love with an absence. Other abscesses</p>
<p>on reality’s veil, yet: you are a person, and I am working
towards</p>
<p>an unbeing, tired to talk and tired to share my feelings –</p>
<p>in a world lacking and maiming them nevertheless.</p>
<p>I don’t know what is worse: the benevolent lie,</p>
<p>or the disruptive truth. I know what I would have done to you, were
you near.</p>
<p>As we continue the journey, we hardly cared about the other, on the
screen: a past, the past</p>
<p>blinking belligerently – at me, past, the other, all these passings,
to remember:</p>
<p>who you were, who I was – in the only thing which isn’t and is</p>
<p>momentary, two surfaces touching in the depth.</p>
<h2>DEAPTHSOF</h2>
<p>A submarine under the North Pole’s ice sheet –</p>
<p>Operation Sunshine.</p>
<p>I don’t care where you are at, but at some point, my exibition</p>
<p>has become your exploration, and your exploration</p>
<p>the exploitative madness I’ve regained.</p>
<p>Western boots and spaghetti with ketchup.</p>
<p>What kind of a belligerence would retain</p>
<p>all that which – we have lost?</p>
<p>The machine is munching on odd money: old bills, boards,</p>
<p>the silence of the rubbish of the happenings,</p>
<p>the non-happening. The boredom one experiences in one’s thirties
–</p>
<p>a hell of a path travelled to the best extent, nel mezzo del
cammino.</p>
<p>You are in the middle (of). The world does turn, but doesn’t turn</p>
<p>around me. Men direct their gaze to the shop windows,</p>
<p>and I am free from the glazes of a freshly born chicken.</p>
<p>To some extent, a woman in her thirties is slimy ’n fried.</p>
<p>Kentucky fried or fresh like a Frisco, I couldn’t say.</p>
<p>We all have some the nostalgia for the other we were – a sweet
sixteen</p>
<p>in a pyroclastic flow, “I don’t mind the fumes, either”, he would
say,</p>
<p>being extinct as a volcano. Of course, going on this journey</p>
<p>on a submarine to prove oneself better than the Soviets,</p>
<p>and most actually succeed, isn’t a failure.</p>
<p>One could even think the Cold War was the most peaceful period –</p>
<p>full stop, unintending, we are munching on explosives and</p>
<p>weapons, in the world where peace (&hellip;).</p>
<p>I look at the screen and I know you exist,</p>
<p>but I might not make the same conclusion, as time goes by.</p>
<p>Listening to your voice coming from other centuries&hellip;,</p>
<p>you might as well become a writer, and I might as well</p>
<p>give up on the word, to let you see the empty page –</p>
<p>as the only beginning, as the only ending,</p>
<p>decent enough to be considered. I could fall in love with your
absence.</p>
<p>You do not see me. The surfaces would touch in the deep.</p>
<p>I could never detach you as I’ve done away with</p>
<p>the weights while diving, following the straight line, going
deeper</p>
<p>at a constant velocity.</p>
<p>One can feel the pressure. And the universe opens up –</p>
<p>just like when travelling into space, so familiar and so
uninhibited,</p>
<p>uninhabited –</p>
<p>the timeline crumbles, and the wire gets detached.</p>
<p>Would I really be there to resurface,</p>
<p>I should change the old habits,</p>
<p>dying, dying, dying. I can’t remain calm</p>
<p>in the calmest of the calm&hellip;</p>
<p>There is a road I am yet to travel,</p>
<p>even though dying from the accumulation of nitrogen in the blood.</p>
<p>Do you think I could solve this with a Calippo,</p>
<p>and simplify things, look at the sunshine</p>
<p>that will fry me – and accept the future?</p>
<p>A future that never came, but has determined me to the very bone?</p>
<p>Go to a psychoanalyst and talk about the anal expressive part</p>
<p>of some of your practices. The pathology of being creative –</p>
<p>lays inside the world where one could never establish</p>
<p>real life consequences in. The true crisis of being alive, and
staying</p>
<p>alive is that of the unability to un-be. Whatever you would
murmur</p>
<p>into my ears, my mind would convert into a metaphor.</p>
<p>I don’t cease being a romantic with a nihilistic glow.</p>
<p>Much like a radioactive fallout, I don’t expect</p>
<p>reality to be radiant. And the lack of that which is becoming
truly</p>
<p>pregnant&hellip; I might as well crawl back to</p>
<p>the womb, that is:the womb, the alphabet, and rewrite it all,</p>
<p>although I couldn’t change the facts and I couldn’t alter the
course.</p>
<p>The midline isn’t the beginning. I truly need to cope with</p>
<p>being alive, throughout the trajectory, which hardly ever</p>
<p>made sense, so that I started to make even less sense,</p>
<p>to cope with all that which wasn’t aligning with</p>
<p>the submarine in question. Sunshine set in – nevertheless,</p>
<p>and the operation was completed. So, take me Hawaii,</p>
<p>leave me exploited, let me derange!</p>
<p>I am only an ice sheet you wanted to get under.</p>
<p>I do not manifest the presence of all that frozen water, turning
me</p>
<p>into an iceberg. Don’t you mean, me being mean, sordid sounds</p>
<p>of the crackling and the cracking,</p>
<p>and the water should break through&hellip; – I am</p>
<p>the most confident about that – , my lungs being filled up,</p>
<p>unable to breath. So that the thoughts and the dialogues</p>
<p>would be arrested, on the exact split of nothing,</p>
<p>where everything is to end and to begin.</p>
<p>Poetry can die within a person,</p>
<p>unless she would be there to become poetry. The only sense I can</p>
<p>still make out of all this flow of – all over the same circles</p>
<p>I am drawing, nevertheless the wish, to get some kick</p>
<p>into the motor. It would be high time to make it kick-start –</p>
<p>regardless the weather and regardless any circumstance.</p>
