I must admit

sunrise is beautiful

watching icicles of light

scrape against cracks in the night

---

I sleep well into the day as

rhythms of the world

assume impostor heartbeats

---

Memories help me collapse

into the unconscious

Sometimes I rest

if only to catch up on the sleep

I lost in my youth

with 8 AM homerooms
{: .ts3 }

and 8:15 gym classes
{: .ts3 }

---

This morning

the wind guides me like a pair

of confident hands

---

Yes

sunrise is beautiful

but no more beautiful

than the dreams I have

or even the nightmares
{: .ts3 }
