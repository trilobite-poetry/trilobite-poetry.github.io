All books should be red or white. Their titles should be opaque
self-contradictions and their imagery should sexualise the familiar.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
Matches are sexual---violent peri-intimate immolations and languorous
plumes of spent affection. All books should have matches on the cover.
Morrisons sells nothing but matches and books with matches on the cover,
and there is always a queue at the self-checkout.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
Beyond the cover, style-guides vary and decisions are (largely) left to
the author, which is where the problems begin.

<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
Not the glossed-out beach litter biographies (*auto*, being here, a
fiction) coughed out by broken-down ghost writers who hate their
subjects almost as much as they hate themselves, but the earnest cris de
cœur of beautiful people who can't imagine anything worse than living in
the obscurity of total cultural dominance in a single field.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
Desperate entreaties from sad-eyed auteurs: I am more than the thing you
know me for---these mansions and private jets and constant praise are
the side-effects of a stopover in a much longer journey. You've saddled
me with too much love and the least you can give me is a few quiet hours
of getting to know my deeper side.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
Guaranteed publication, granted best-seller status by default, these
vapid tomes are just weighty enough to beat Barthes' brains out and
resurrect the author as the medium.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
With apologies to Ethan Hawke, the Platonic ideal of this type of
celebrity, from whose ribs tiny Chalamets were planted and who may well
be (as the dust-jacket of his most recent novel, *A Bright Ray of
Darkness* declares) 'one of the most acclaimed artists of his
generation', this is not a review---it will not engage with the merits
and drawbacks of his prose because they had nothing to do with its
arrival in the zeitgeist.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
Ethan's publishers understand the value of a match on the cover as well
as they do the enormous, bead-necklaced spectre of his face on the back,
exiling the blurb to the interior where it is much less likely to
influence the average shopper's decision to buy it.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
The internet is now turgid with humanless art---hideous monkey
placeholders that serve as unregulated currency and lichenous indicators
of the basest consumer cynicism jostle with neural nets sifting and
regurgitating alien fragments of the entirety of recorded knowledge.
Meanwhile, literature by committee like this book with Ethan's face on
it is itself becoming an anachronism (as are self-satisfied rants about
it from much less successful writers). However, there is still value in
confronting them.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
Not only because, in the hypochondriac industry of Big Five publishing,
which drafts its own obituary every few months before declaring record
sales, recognisable faces are safe bets, hoarding the oxygen which might
be given to new writers, but because uncritical support of celebrities
is anathema to both creative expression and accountability.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
On a small scale, this sycophancy might manifest a John Krasinski, so
drunk off his hungry friends' approval that he genuinely believed a show
focused exclusively on *Good News* during a time of abject global
suffering was either original or necessary.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
Left unchallenged, it grows darker: swarms of Peterson-reared quasi-mass
shooters and Tumblr rejects proving collective action is a double-edged
sword by setting a legal precedent that prevents abuse victims from
speaking out, all because they loved Captain Jack Sparrow; alleged
(obvious) rapists like Bill Clinton being rebranded as jovial crime
novelists, sharing shelf-space with (the admittedly blameless) Ethan.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
As the prevailing culture rolls corpse-like down an embankment to a
state in which every creative space is invested only in celebrities and
computers, perhaps the easiest thing to do would be to remove the reader
all together. Every bot that can be an artist is also by obligation an
audience and can therefore be a critic. Reprogramme Goodreads and the
New York Times book review that said Ethan had 'a fluid storytelling
voice and the imagination to create complicated individuals' by
replacing the uncomplicated individuals in both with a code of universal
acclaim; corral the wealthy in blockchains of unremitting praise and
leave them to it.

They will be happy, and when the winter comes, we can all freeze in
peace.
