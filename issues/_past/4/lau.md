## Savage Detectives and Suicide Girls

The parasitic situationists lasted ten years.

They captured the colonel with a blow to the head.

They clanged with illusions like a street fair.

---

The coast was proxy war zone of pleasures, fears.

They mimicked the painted, elaborate dead.

The parasitic situationists lasted ten years.

---

They came after the end of the Party. It ever nears.

They left raw marks. Stoke, channel, harness. They branded.

They clanged with illusions like a street fair.

---

They sought the police who wanted some ears.

Autocorrect is a bitch, they said as they snitched.

The parasitic situationists lasted ten years.

---

These years turned, made them harmless like gears.

They feared every new war; ascetic, purified,

they clanged with illusions like a street fair.

---

Its jawbone for sale, their future had just a few spears

of grass to eat, consumed by fire they administered.

The parasitic situationists lasted ten years.

They clanged with illusions like a street fair.

## How Their Juuls, Vapes, and Phones Were Dirty

Steely, dirty, the moon crosses the reeds in a pond

the second dream of the high-tension line step

down transformer, the 5G Literary Guillotine.

Stoned with interference,

she wandered the lawn recited verses dawn.

---

She was up next day not till night, four days that way

until she dug her grave at the pound. Where

the wine was traditional, she wore a party top.

Later she showered against the artificial

rain wall at the mall. Commercial

---

rates were down. When I met her

she showed me their phones for a time.

Image: they were crowded outside the white-collar office,

image: they were leaving the factory

in overalls, image: they were writing in a mental

---

institution in Beijing near fields

in their fifth month of a sequester,

image: they were concentrating on the maiden

of orchid blossoms. The gauze of killer

silk and fish scales revealed her

---

posts about kids and fuchsia bulbs.

An assassin surrounded with idiots,

she soaked up a white concrete sun

like the ocean deprived of waves.

Passionate winds of internet affect called

---

out to her from a path

through the wall of ping pong tables. Nothing

but parties, she sucked on the lit end of matches

for the cologne of a candy star. The world was quiet

her last night while she disfigured their stones.

## Canonical Form

Your family lived in the surgical mist

protected by a layer of city. Different

---

districts, brick steps in the park

the neighbor Egyptians coded,

---

were blazing to touch like

this smart city's pixels

---

beyond the edge of the gameplay.

In the crumbling industrial region

---

your camera penetrated a surface water falling

from a rocky cliff. No below, the now's

---

outlawry left on a swift horse out of plague town.

Grand theft was gently anti-Cartesian,

---

the old phone against the new phone.

## Breath of a Wok

Time travel on the way to the market,

river tempo, eddy, whirlpool,

knife in the left-handed *apiero---*

you end up earlier than before you begin

but unable to start over, April Theses,

wormholes, Jacobins

drink bad beer and sleep rough

on the floor of a super-civilization.
