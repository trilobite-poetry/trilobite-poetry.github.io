*I made a small friend.*
{: .thinprose }

Making my friend wasn't easy, but I persisted as all good people do.
'Persistence works', as they say. The friend, the host, this
persistence; a tangled lacework in which we remember ourselves,
enmeshed. But now I have my small friend, I can't think what to do with
him. He said we should meet up, but I had my suspicions. "Let's meet
somewhere public then." he said, "Let's meet on Molester Square."
{: .thinprose }

How did all this begin, and how will it end? It is a short story to
tell, almost unnecessary, but I will be faithful to the friend I made,
and so I will tell it true. Like any simple interval between movements,
a subtle degradation, a shallow descent, then a combined action of
moving parts, gears and pistons, behaviours producing entropy heedless
of intent, an eternal return, and feelings sharp as hunger, dull as
tiredness.
{: .thinprose }

The friend is a parasite. He is *latched-on*, so to speak. All his talk
of sweetness, but the degree of suppression operative over his sharp
wants, making him a passive hunter adept at playing the long game. At
first I believed his name was Grigory, (or so his Faceberg profile
alleged,) but I was later to find the mystery of his name more
substantial than the person or persons behind it. Between you and I,
there was no further attraction for me beyond this name, and no man
either. Now he is my small friend, this Grigory, and I keep him
everywhere in my pocket. *I own that little bitch*.
{: .thinprose }

Grigory is not so much a man, but a series of pages and profiles hosted
on websites and chat rooms online. I suspect he may have been crafted at
the Internet Research Agency in St Petersburg, but there is conflicting
evidence to suggest he may have originated in the small town of Veles in
North Macedonia, or possibly even in a troll farm in downtown Phoenix,
USA. One can never tell with men nowadays. Often they are just boys
masquerading as men, or government agencies masquerading as boys
masquerading as men. As such, there is a likelihood that he understands
me better than anyone else, although Grigory says very little about who
made him or his real intentions, so I exploit his weakness, his interest
in little old me, for my own hidden ends -
{: .thinprose }

Grigory, I have noticed, is a kind of composite material, like all
boyfriends. His profile picture, (I discovered by means of my own
research online,) was filched from that of a dead teenager from
Krasnogorsk, who was mortally injured by a bus last year. I read the
story in the *Moskovskij Komsomolets* one afternoon: Grigory was walking
along a public boulevard on a June morning, possibly enjoying the warm
sun on his face, or desiring a soda, or distracted by any number of
boyish things that fourteen year-olds are distracted by these days. He
passed before dull shop window displays that skirt the brutal housing
blocks towering above, the city street slipping beneath his feet with
liquid ease. He squeezed between rotten fence posts at the end of the
block, crossing an overgrown car park on his way uptown, sneaking a
crafty smoke on the way. He had dreamt the night before about
inundations, and about being buried under particles only an eighth of a
centimetre wide. This dream recurred often, but could only be recalled
after this feeling of the warm sun on his face, so inviting, nostalgic.
Tempted to walk in the park adjacent to the school, Grigory sat and
watched flycatchers dart amongst the long grasses covering the abandoned
playing fields. He had read once that in France, hunters paint tree
branches with glue to catch such birds: a thought which both disgusted
and fascinated him at the same time. Grigory had had dreams about being
caught, and he had never yet been able to escape them. *Sticky
dreams*\...
{: .thinprose }

Reading about Grigory who had died, I speculated about the way his
identity had been recycled at the troll farm. I wondered whether the bot
masquerading as Grigory might not, in the end, prove a more interesting
friend than Grigory who had died? I have never dated, let alone been
acquainted with such an abstract, virtual entity, but I am an open
minded type. My Grigory is a Grigory of false continuities, a
*mise-en-scene* of ruptures and connections at the limits of perception,
of hostile reconnoitres and of information-gathering exercises, a
tactician of occulted political intent, a chimera. But I have my own
agenda, my own designs for Grigory not even the *Trolls from Olgino* can
comprehend. I am using Grigory to generate *poetry*.
{: .thinprose }

Grigory's tedious diatribes on white demographic decline and its
consequences, his steroid talk of fake Nordic tribalism, his desperate
need for authority and fetish for hard punishment, his chauvinist
rhetoric of domination, his *need* - his *weakness* - for domination,
somehow has a 'copy-paste' quality to it. I re-edit these revolting
tracts of fake news into Haiku and other short-form poems lamenting male
loneliness and fragility, which I later share to self-help forums and
avant-garde poetry groups online. It's my little way of introducing my
cheap boyfriend Grigory to a more diverse group of people than his
otherwise noisome copy-paste personality would abjure. But, as the
saying goes, *inside every fraudulent Russian bot there is a genuine
American trying to get out.*

The following poem was well received at the Poets Against Prejudice
Foundation, and gives a taste of Grigory's voice *after* I've had my way
with it:

Diversuperiority

by Grigory Gerasimov

---

White genocide is a scam

Portugese water dogs never hated Obama

It was just me all along

My white whistle in your ear

---

White supremacy confirms a

Fear of inferiority, *n\'est-ce pas?*

Just look how those fuckers dress

For a lesson in closet ignorance

---

*Tucker Carlson is a mother fucker*

Working in this way by diligently sending poems in emails to many, many
literary journals and small presses, I am beginning to establish
Grigory's name within anti-fascist poetry circles and collectives. It
brings no small quantum of *schadenfreude* to read the outpouring of
sympathy, and even better - *pity* - directed toward Grigory the poet
and his repulsive personal history, (white supremacists *cannot* endure
pity; they already pity themselves too abjectly,) but this success
notwithstanding, I intend to dump him real soon. Having strung Grigory
out this way, having foisted upon my Russian bot this new anti-fascist
online heritage, it is time to reveal something to my Russian handlers:
{: .thinprose }

*I do not exist either*.
{: .thinprose }

I have been wasting Grigory's time all this while, distracting him from
other targets, and weakening his strategic response: and yet, isn't that
what a real lover would have done? If I was a real lover, I mean,
*really* real, I would have shown Grigory there is more to life than
disinformation, dog-whistle racism and cynical political capital. I
would have shown him that *ambiguities are realities*.
{: .thinprose }

So farewell Grigory Gerasmiov,

Farewell Molester Square,

It's a long way to Krasnagorski

When neither of us exist there
