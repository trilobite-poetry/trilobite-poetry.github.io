## Walking Papers

*If you forgot the word for water*   
*would your grass get brown*   
*plants all die&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horses*   
*could you walk to France?*   
*Would your rice be hard*   
*skin be soapy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pranks fall flat*   
*strokes get airy*   
*if you left the word in a drawer somewhere*   
*would your clothes be wet and moldy*   
*or your papers stiff and thick*   
*would you go to work with a dry mouth*   
*and forget the word for work?*

the sleek voter   
skiis to her   
trite shiny altar   
chimes in poser:   
labor's my spice.   
voters all tripe.   
crime it's clear   
the poser's shine.   
radar spies shekels   
a boner's tripe.   
whose roper shines?   
later valor aloft   
sleek goner who   
ate the alpo.   
in a trice   
tribe's in arrears.

*I totally refused to be elided.*   
*To be unlit I'd be undelighted.*   
*My bright smile would be benighted.*

## Swilo

It was out of my   
I could not   
Sharp it?   
{: .ts6 }

---

Every chord needs a   
Can I have a   
Drift?   
{: .ts6 }

---

You store expressions in   
You cannot sing the   
Swilo?   
{: .ts6 }

---

See you on the street,   
Tip my hat, say   
"Dowdy!"   
{: .ts6 }

---

Her voice had a   
grasp   
{: .ts6 }

---

He landed with a   
third   
{: .ts6 }

---

They offed many birds with the   
lingo   
{: .ts6 }

---

The welling all starts in the   
howdy.

## Assange

time to resist   
to speak up   
you can be   
where are we   
who are we   
are we awake   
our eyes open   
or just nodding   
off in dreamland   
who are you   
taking messages to   
where do you   
draw your line   
who can you   
trust to help   
when do you   
keep your distance

*Give me good eyesight*   
*in this life of mine*   
*Let me see clearly*   
*in my own time.*

## Owly Obly

Who would agist our lost   
lambs? We rouse them   
daily, for what ought?   
Is it folly to find food for   
fifty? The flock has no plank   
in this vessel, he said obly.   
It was tough to face the apish   
blast, you couldn't pay me in coral.   
Whogh! Something's amiss   
when the lowly are treated so   
cooly. She has to look it in   
the face every day, despite her   
degrees, as a whole country   
shifts to new enemies to   
hate hotly. Someone deserves   
a good slamp. Golly, Lora,   
it's a tough thicket, said the   
owly ageist. But it's a blast   
raising the clang, said Owly   
obly, as the silent thunder   
rang the lowly larm.

## Cooperation

Who put the U in build?
{: .ts6 }

You and I came together
{: .ts6 }

for once in a birthright
{: .ts12 }

Not without guilt
{: .ts6 }

The Homage to Quarrelsome
{: .ts6 }

Words we built
{: .ts8 }

The sleeper in the food
{: .ts6 }

co-op caf√© snores
{: .ts8 }

in the only easy chair there
{: .ts8 }

While a worker on his
{: .ts6 }

break sits at a table
{: .ts8 }

watching the world go by
{: .ts8 }

then rising, pushes in chairs
{: .ts6 }

so each empty table is
{: .ts8 }

ready
{: .ts8 }

Thus quoth a poet
{: .ts6 }

If you want I could
{: .ts6 }

teach you a bunch
{: .ts8 }

and guarantee rock
{: .ts6 }

bottom grades
{: .ts8 }

You & I put the hell in
{: .ts6 }

quilt, stood in a cue
{: .ts8 }

and had rock-bottom tea.
{: .ts8 }

Thus quote the peach.
{: .ts6 }

Some like to invade, but
{: .ts6 }

the faded jade with the mad
{: .ts8 }

mead on the dazed beach says
{: .ts8 }

to evade is
{: .ts8 }

a far better idea.
{: .ts8 }

All that's left is the
{: .ts6 }

bit about birth falling
{: .ts8 }

from the, quoth, proud cloud.
{: .ts8 }

"Enjoy the view," says the view.

## Taken

It's taken!   
Just walk away   
it's taken!   
You could do me a solid   
Jack if you took a   
powder.   
The slick blimp   
bumped into the   
eagle barging into   
the cocktail lounge   
She's taken!   
{: .ts6 }

Doing covid is no   
excuse for avoiding   
the clean bliss of   
wakening the   
&nbsp;L&nbsp;&nbsp;I O   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O D   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L   
Can you glean this   
in your lager bliss,   
Galea? It's kneat   
it's legal, it's   
soiled, it clicks,   
it's taken.
