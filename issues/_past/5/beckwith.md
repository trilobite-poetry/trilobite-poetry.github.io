For awhile my most used word was "unhinged"

but lately

it is "absolutely"

Naughty may

endure but

Mutability

I feel like a painful boat

Whole body skin cuts

Mothers and other unwanted women<sup><a href="#108n" id="108r">108</a></sup>

Everything about the act ~~of writing~~ seems to invite abuse -- 

its solitary nature, its interiority, the misery of sharing yourself

with

an often-indifferent audience<sup><a href="#109n" id="109r">109</a></sup>

---

It's off

The beast

Eating breakfast with my partner's lover

One of the issues around here is a failure to acknowledge

that being is becoming<sup><a href="#112n" id="112r">112</a></sup>

I heard parents ordering

children out of strollers with a variant

of "we didn't come here for nothing.<sup><a href="#113n" id="113r">113</a></sup>

Didn't give you minutes

not even moments<sup><a href="#114n" id="114r">114</a></sup>

They live in "Place"<sup><a href="#115n" id="115r">115</a></sup>

strange stars

not of this world

Other times I would check my messages

in the morning to find a picture

of spilled juice with the caption: "just spilled my juice"<sup><a href="#116n" id="116r">116</a></sup>

Every form of energy in this picture is spiral

Breathing in I imagine myself as a flower

Breathing out I release freshness

Breathing in, flower

Breathing out, freshness

## Cellular voltage

Scientific and medical studies have proven

nutrition and exercise are both key factors

in optimal health and prevention and recovery from illness,

but there's another important factor that's often overlooked:

---

## Voltage
{: #voltage}

---

Think of your body as a cell phone

just as daily use drains this battery

our everyday lives diminish the voltage in our cells

---

virtually *anyone* could benefit

from restored cellular voltage

regardless of age or health

---

The three most important factors in cellular health are
{: .nospace}

1. Voltage

2. Nutrition

3. And dealing with toxicity

---

What you'll find as a common characteristic of all disease is

inadequate cellular voltage<sup><a href="#118n" id="118r">118</a></sup>

More than half the country needs to be windmills

Breathing in, sun

Breathing out, brightness

---

Ahhh that's sad, bruv, I woulda cut their head off

to be merciful

---

Don't get psyched out by futility<sup><a href="#121n" id="121r">121</a></sup>

---

And don't cry when I'm eating, please

I'm in love with

my sadness<sup><a href="#123n" id="123r">123</a></sup>

a kind tool

a ton of eggs<sup><a href="#124n" id="124r">124</a></sup>

an agential straight-jacket<sup><a href="#125n" id="125r">125</a></sup>

How dare I

desire

what I've been trained

my whole life to desire

---

just by living
