Come, rest your drowned head in my basket

I will bring you down to the tavern tonight

Wrapped in a blue and gold silk scarf

---

I will tend to the tears you never cried

I will wave off the mites looking for

blood still bubbling in your veins

---

Come, rest your drowned head in my basket

I will tend to the tears you never cried

I will bring you down to the tavern tonight

---

But I won't sing your praises

No, I won't sing your praises

Nor will I pray for a better future

---

Come, rest your drowned head in my basket
