## Pantoum Blowjob

Suck my dick beneath this bathroom stall.

Get down there and give me head.

Wrap fresh lips around the shaft.

Suck my cock and call me master, cracker.

---

Get down there and give me head

And use some spit on this blackboy's dick

While you suck my cock and call me master, cracker

For I don't want to see your face for days.

---

Use some spit on this blackboy's dick.

Play with the head.

I don't want to see your face for days

Nor do I care to know your name.

---

Play with the head

I said, you know how much I like that.

I don't want to know your name

But you can taste my cum.

---

I think you would like that.

Men tell me I taste like chicken.

You want to taste my cum?

Deep throat it.

---

Men tell me my cum taste like chicken

But you better not give me teeth

When you deep throat it

As my thighs are ajar like two car doors.

---

You better not give me teeth.

I don't want your phone number after this

When my thighs are shut

And I'm wiping up our mess.

## Soul Sister

We used to get along so well.

I would chase you around the house

like brothers always do.

Hold you down,

---

arms pinned playfully at age seven

to carpet until you gave back

my *DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince* tape.

*Leave that girl alone,*

---

mama yells

as she baptizes the chicken in flour.

---

You were the baby of the family

who got away with everything.

Panties left on the bathroom floor,

---

Barbie dolls soaking off&nbsp;&nbsp;make-up

in soapy bath water.

You are the girl I ate

Froot Loops with in the den.

---

Remember when we use to run

to the bathroom and lock ourselves away

from mama's leather belt of love?

*The two of yall can't be using the bathroom at the same time,*

she would scream.

---

So I would open the door and push you out.

You would migrate to your room,

squeeze your Care Bear

until the fear subsided

---

into more important things

like *Strawberry Shortcake* coloring books.

And then we grew up.

I moved from *Red Rider BB Guns*

---

to the car keys of mama's

Monte Carlo.

You went from a Huffy bicycle,

to the wonders of lip-stick

---

and a crush on a guy named Michael Jackson.

Now your into LL Cool J to my

Tori Amos.

We have become like the grown folks

---

we weren't supposed to be around.

You have breasts.

I have chest hair and journals fueled with poems.

---

You had a baby and named her Jasmine Mulan

I went to college to study Creative Writing.

You moved out when the ten o'clock

curfews became worse than root canals.

---

I stayed to decorate

my walls with *Janet Jackson* posters

and tolerate mama's complaints

like slaps in the face.

---

Now we hardly talk,

and I feel as if I need

to introduce myself to you

as your brother all over again.

## CHUCK

Whatcha got there between those tie-died buttons,

Centerfold skin, layers of sexy flesh?

What is it that your zipper barricades

Above the belt, below those pitch black inseams?

Anklebone in those cotton tube socks.

---

I see those eraser nipples pressing through the oxford shirt.

I want to lick your steel-toed boots.

Come on Chuck and step on my face.

Come over to my place after work.

---

I'll leave the door unlocked

Waiting naked like a porno star

In that queen sized bed.

---

I'll wait to peel off those black slacks,

Rip off that standard issued paisley vest.

Shove the bow tie in your mouth

In case you need to bite down on something.

---

Show me you're hard on.

Issue yellow streams of urine

Pass a black man's beard.

Piss splashes against chin,

Trickling down neck,

Into an Afro of chest hair

That settles into belly button.

---

I want to give you the feeling of another

Man's saliva drying on your prick.

---

Let me know before you come

Because there are some things, I just won't do.
