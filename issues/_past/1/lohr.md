Ignore convention a while

And in return get this nice joke

Yeah, I like Sarah McLachlan *Plenty*

Hopefully building just enough to get it

And then

Get it by *getting* it

And getting *how* to get it

"Begotten"

So to speak by

Surfacing obfuscation together

---

...

---

Look up rorate

That is the image

---

Sheltering

From text

---

Or also

As assembly

---

...

---

Picture coast

Becoming coast

Strings swelling in

Breathing

Snoring brass

---

...

---

If you feel bored

Redraw the radio mystery

Shocking comparisons

From billions to circumference

---

God-display of mechanism

Clocks made

Hour's a symbol woven throughout

---

Material

Then

Silence built to schedule

---

Fermenting Monstrance

Defenestration

Encasement pointing

Not diegetic

---

...

---

Tinnitus echoes our interlude

Municipal & Interlude

---

Transportation plates in orbit

Edges scrape around each surface

---

What percentage of this is artifact

& which generation

---

Laid sheet on plaid

Numbers are exact blur

---

Hold up an image

A planet against the planet

---

Search through flux of cold

Chasing hot color vehicles

---

Now aged & it's speckled

Expected

---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another chuckle

---

That Trotskyist typeface is funny today

Evoking their hand-written signs

---

Ironic

It's immutability loss

Pinpoints the referent's prime

---

...

---

Memento Mori

---

A tattoo of a skeleton smoking a cigarette,

holding a banner that says 'it's a living'

---

...

---

This is only half of the solo

---

Delay

Forgotten

---

A new pope elected in the factory

Smoke or

---

Constructing another pilgrimage

Whichever takes precedence

---

...

---

Where'd I find this recitation?

---

*Knows how memory can fail*

*When someone is strapped to a printing press*

---

...

---

Job offer:

Henosis

---

Unsuccessful

Attempts to jump

Dielectric & dialectic

---

Losing opera and lumber

Yeasts with each fermentation

---

...

---

Orchestration follow libretto

set in Linotype plates

---

Saints

atonal

glockenspiel

---

The

book

I

remembered

is

the

one

I

imagine.

---

Staple

stack

of

sheets

into

publication.

---

Press

repeats.

---

...

---

Scharmel Iris play

Occult tying the long desires

Romantic to Modern of

---

Attaining aristocracy

Specific celebrity

Join me in silence and cunning

---

...

---

What I've been afraid to say

The memory remains

& unobliviated

Yet

Static resonating

---

I just work here

A pneumatic tube

Extended from that mural

Proscenium from the representative

Reflection of the past.

---

...

---

Voices harmonized to synthetic

Horns sound

Hard to tell

Rasterized

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like pastiche

---

The shift from quotations

Ends with an offness

Draped flattening calculations

Curves lines to sheets

Without scale

---

Cover the world

Like really world

Well, liquidity &

Light precedes

an overtaken dialogic
