<p>Before all else my greetings to all poets, dead or alive.</p>

<hr />

<p>My dead (standing firmly behind me) perpetually sing my
name:</p>

<hr />

<p><em>in ortu sanguinis per peregrinationem casus ade elementa
surceperunt gaudia in te</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s the living that can’t stop haunting me. They seem deader
than the dead. The dead feed me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do you think this has grown as some sort of natural psychic
mutation of the age?</p>

<hr />

<p>Perhaps it has something to do with being in the mountains, or
the wine of my own voice.</p>

<hr />

<p>I belong to Shiva.</p>

<hr />

<p>I looked inside my body for my soul. I only found the
blue-throated one.</p>

<hr />

<p>There was no soul.</p>

<hr />

<p>A slave of extremes, I'm both dead and alive: I have no need to</p>

<p>extract the stone of madness.</p>

<hr />

<p>One can't be crazy enough. I'm both Eurydice and Orpheus. I'm
perpetually giving birth. My </p>

<p>body is <em>schrecklich</em>. In fact "the" body is
<em>schrecklich</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>All bodies are <em>schrecklich</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thinking about this body something curiously effervescent where</p>

<p>good and evil reunite, absorbs me. I'm a microbe dwelling on a
microbe orbiting a microbe.</p>

<hr />

<p>Language is the final frontier.</p>

<hr />

<p>Yet like birds in need of a branch to land on, words need our
flesh</p>
