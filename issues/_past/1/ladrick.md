## 1.

Something gorgeous in a

tinted eyebrow. A shoulder

slathered in self tanner. Teeth

whitened with a kit bought

online.

---

All little ways of hiding the fact

that the house that you were born in

is crumbling at the corners.

I stole that line from a song

it's a good one and we all do

our professions make our

protestations

---

Primal human activities

require

art.

## 2.

The house that you were

born in is crumbling at

the corners.

Falling apart as they say

run down

overrun

How the river runs

is no concern

of mine.

## 3.

Writing just something

just something small

Just something little with a

feeling for the breaks

Stop saying "just" they

told me to stop qualifying

But how will I know.

## 4.

Heartbreak poems your poem

is crumbling at the corners

Your house is a nuisance and you

you are the most of all.

## 5.

When it comes knocking you

feel it come not with claws

but with the softest paws

The gentle weight of a large

cat easing its way onto your chest

---

It takes up the space and leaves

only after awhile do you feel

the hurt of it

Sometimes the softest

paw is a claw.

## 6.

Your body crumbling each twinge

in your back a knife of age

ouch that was dramatic

how do we listen to dashboard as

unhinged 40 year old men wearing

shorts on a 50 degree day

---

nobody warm enough everybody

enjoying the vibe change but still

crumbling constantly an emotional

state is fucked it's a vote away

from the writing on the wall

---

my house a house of age

a miracle of savior and luck

a pluck of injectables holding

together a blend of rocks and

bird feathers

## 7.

Curating a collection of body

parts but only the nice ones

this isn't horror poetry I'm not

foreign and shocking just

average 30-something slowly

falling apart eating frozen pizza

on the couch every Friday night

---

always fascinated by the idea

entropy---that everything tends

toward falling and where's

the proof that we're not eroding

slowly stop making the necessaries

a birthday cake of a skull in the shape

of a heart writ "memento mori"
