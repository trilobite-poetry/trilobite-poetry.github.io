We married under the sign of the green triumvirate

Clover manifested its destiny

And nothing we peel off in greenbacks

Oh the hooligans and their howling. How ho. What do you know? And at

for you to reside in. May you find peace among the ruminations of the

ancients

May you swallow all the bitterness of this moment.

Be the peacock we need. Transform and purge.

Verde que te quero verde. The green how I love you green

The river making love the whole length of the singularity

Nascent anchovies. A nation of stinky fish
