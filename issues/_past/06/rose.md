Was has soft gravel

to jump double-butch

wants to quiet the burn

---

Was has soft adams apple

behind their back, to trust

Was held in one hand

---

Was has soft palms

has unreadable features

gives and recedes sand

---

butch gravel Was double

long elegant fingers

soft doesn’t give much

{: .newpoem }

strings,

lime light
{: .indent }

the body begs

in the mouth of

things at the foot

of things under-

toeing the linear

reasoning

stems

*fate*

(the body aches)

&nbsp;yearn to smile

with just the body

---

my tongue like a laser

blinds, as sunshine

on a wide river;

know how it flows

as your tongue
{: .indent }

can twist
{: .indent4 }

words in
{: .indent4 }

to elegant knots
{: .indent2 }

cheers to elegant knots

(the butt of

who cannot

tell the truth)
{: .indent2 }

jokes
{: .indent2 }

you can tell
{: .indent2 }

by their teeth
{: .indent2 }
