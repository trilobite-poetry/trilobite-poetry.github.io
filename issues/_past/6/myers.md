Quiet day

Sunday

My last days

of work ahead

this week

before new job

Same troubles

troubling

my mind

---

Morning coffee

& music

News of

Syl Johnson's

death arrives

JJ puts on

a record

& Syl's voice

floats in from

the other

room / Electric

this shock

the call to

dance

---

I read

some poems

give myself

space to think

Happy

to encounter

mystery

there is no need

to explain

Consider Hoa

Nguyen's to "live

variously"

& feel like

I am

---

Now, early

afternoon

stream women's

college basketball

Enjoy these

slow hours

before nightfall

& the setting

of alarms

Monday morning

just there

on the horizon
