## Involuous

In the wobbly space of

the way my body smells

---

ice clear Wisconsin air

see your breath

---

a purple goblin

a turquoise bike

a miniature American flag

Minnie Mouse

painted on a dead stump

tipped over lawn chairs

what might be

raspberry bushes

---

A napping dog

opens his eyes

---

Who's allowed to have the mauve

was it oak

to say the world

lost its letters

---

Ravaging the end of this pandemic

the bigger better assumption

flooded in prismatic light

---

fire

place

nonnegotiable

---

I hibernate like a bear

dreaming of sea turtles

kit houses

---

Come back into your toes

---

unstriving

## Actors that are Other Talent

I'm any case

---

The flowers speak passionately

from the kitchen table

about their time

beneath the earth

stems gluing away in water

---

On the wall

I'm the gallery

an oversized replica

of a folding measuring stick

painting on the collective edges

wood extending

an arm and leg below

---

At the opening someone moved it

tried to make it

work

---

It came off the wall

breaking where it was attached

---

During the lecture the distraught gallerist

came to me and whispered

*'is there an enraged man in the room'*

---

Wearing a flowered orange sundress

I walked up Brady Street in the snow

to the intimate Italian place

wanting tiramisu

---

Instead I leave with two different colored boots

walking away

trying to read text messages

on the tips of my fingers

beneath my gloves

---

There's almost always an enraged man in the room

whether or not there's any rage

---

How do I translate

fragility

the end of birthdays

when breath continues

---

Go back to the book that says

vomit first

then make art

between moons and footsteps

## Nice Toilet

Killing someone by shrinking them

turning them to dryer lint

stuffing them into a cigar box

and stabbing them repeatedly with a cheap ballpoint pen

while singing the Oscar Mayer bologna song

has to mean something right

---

Fuck that noise

---

Toy our invilement

## You Tell Me

Good vibes here

if nowhere else

---

Window of tolerance

---

What cold power

an unrivaled deep state sleep

snoring its statement

---

How much butter would be needed

---

How much would it cost

---

To sculpt the word FAT

in balloon letters

and then pin a pastel floral pattern from the late 80s to it

---

Money makes it appear

## As if the Page Didn't Exist

I imagine everything healing

potholes

bomb craters

---

Beneath all the death and decay

a loamy nothing

in utero

---

In a room full of kittens and puppies

I want to see the machine

that purifies your blood

even if it's boring

---

What if there were no goals

only dreams to reach into

the poem's insistent allowing

---

When the body expands expands expands

beyond the world machine's ability to contain it

---

What delight can be

dancing outside

---

Scorched earth maps a topography of the dead

the alphabet isn't a clock or chronology

they still haven't invented smell-o-vision

---

Here in the abiding canopy

of nighttime green

---

In ancient in ancient

Hazards to the blow the now

## What do the Fabrics Say

The pray is out tasting the moonlight

on a pool float

looking like Nick Cave

---

Ask your father

on the hourly

---

Suspended on spongy peat

in a brick house

---

I lost half this poem

by deleting a text

on a different device

---

Best part

way the diorama

folds in on itself

---

hot glue lets go

piece parts

now shoppable again

---

fox skull painted bronze

porcelain lady legs

plaster teeth

plastic jewels

nylon flowers

---

bring these birds to my dream

how nice to drift

---

Fuck the hustle

let's streak

---

Like salads

I keep liking things by accident

---

strife

or stroking

streaking or stroking

spring has disappeared

winter boom

sublimates to summer

---

Is it even possible

to know shit from Shinola

---

feet fear feet feat

---

Like your face

the wood needs to be moisturized

---

even death

shouldn't dry out too much
