Come for party pies, stick

your hunting dogs on us, I

beg you. I left a smooth pebble

in your oven. I cursed a fat

snail, rendered it large and inedible

---

Flash your cards at a doorway

entrance and receive your pass:

a shin bone. These dogs, I tell you!

Like they've never had a normal night

in their lives. When they cease to hunt

we nibble some feathers in sync

---

My soupy brain is splash happy

I'm forked out with sharp nails

---

yes, it's the joke, but my large son

asked for it & we tossed our limbs

into the casserole dish, doled it out

in seconds

That evening, we are laughing at this commercial,

frosted tips flashback , daughter glued
{: .indent1 }

to screen, waves

lasagne sheets rippling from the kitchen

---

We topped a guy using the trampoline springs

uur daughter trained up,
{: .indent1 }

fleshed out for adulthood & growth conflict

---

In the morning I wheeled it around long enough: the big

cone with our flash looks for summer

---

you're holding the point of it

---

we bicker daily over which suburban

mums will hear our sales pitch.

You wrote all your best poems years ago

(this is your line) and I've yelled in return
{: .indent1 }

---

I'm not anyone's toy poet, I'm no play thing(!)

---

So we are stalking through the suburbs & big

cone follows, or leads maybe?

---

Depends on the hill strength

in any case, the time for discretion is

over & we begin

phase three
