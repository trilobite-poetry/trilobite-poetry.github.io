title: poem from *Patience*
contributor: Eric Sneathen
issue: troublesome hierophanies
---

i try to be convincing

---

the birds in rippling

---

circular movements

---

i try to notice nothing

---

but a singular cloud

---

of life drifting above

---

but it keeps unspooling

---

outlasting my emptiness

---

& such was my history

---

this was its particularity

---

& i copied its gesture

---

until i couldn’t bear it

---

any longer a cloud

---

& my hands corrected

---

& my posture shifted

---

into the communal life

---

of me & my hands

---

making the container

---

i’m still in pain here

---

i’m thronging masses

---

of wild nerves & wild

---

to take off & at last

---

the sweetest escape

---

of these lovely songs

---

the empty fig trees

---

after a long summer

---

i like to fall in love

---

like the sun is rising

---

over the cold blue

---

ridge i lift up my legs

---

over the misty edge

---

of what happened

---

& wanted to disappear

---

holding a sanctuary or

---

maybe it’s just a cloud

---

but i still have loving

---

the container of me

---

& let it go forward

---

& around each face

---

like the petals turning

---

this one is pretty &

---

the lizard is a guide

---

heating up its heart

---

this one is quite daring

---

from deep within

---

& everything grown

---

like this flower here

---

this basket is woven

---

or a button stitched

---

into my second-hand

---

garment like honey

---

it’s hardly anymore

---

of me & me hands

---

i’m using my tusks

---

to get further into

---

the sideways motion

---

of the animals i am

---

the snout & hoof

---

to say with sweetness

---

the pretty petals i am

---

only a surface &

---

i try to notice nothing

---

when i look down

---

into the night water

---

the stars as a sanctuary

---

the water & the life

---

from this happening

---

sleeping from the sun

---

it looks like work

---

it only looks like

---

my pain is particular

---

the name for a bird

---

disappearing into heat

---

i sweat myself apart

---

from nomenclature

---

i would escape

---

i would hide experience

---

from myself if i

---

could hideaway language

---

or the image apart

---

from the happening

---

as petals of experience

---

this rose might be

---

cleft & without clarity

---

i still have myself &

---

i was only a shape

---

of a cloud i noticed

---

bruised by particularity

---

& this is a confession

---

the singular hopelessness

---

of my very own life

---

it happened in the heart

---

something incalculable

---

to be so & extinguished

---

to give into another

---

light of me to contain it

---

pouring from the eyes

---

it was so difficult

---

to be worth it truly

---

& then i turned it over
