**Parallel Compression**: This is a trick I haven’t talked about to
you guys yet but can come in very handy for pretty much any thing
that needs air or a better attack tone. Instead of using a dbx
I’m using a modern compression (c1) and compressing the kick
extremely hard so that pretty much a top kick sound is left. I
add a ton of high end using the V-EQ (Neve) and notch out
low-mids. This results in a very bright thin kick sounds (all
attack like a top kick). I blend this in with the original kick
to get a defined overall kick sound helping the drive off the
song out better.
