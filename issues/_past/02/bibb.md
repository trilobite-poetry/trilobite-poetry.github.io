<p>Of my hurdles</p>
<hr />
<p>Breaking through the hordes of one's on uptown the oblivion</p>
<hr />
<p>Haven't you heard? There's a new broadcast of innovation.</p>
<hr />
<p>A trash n' burn lapse tactic for 1 million lucky winners</p>
<hr />
<p>As you proceed to alien ate my burns around the ankles</p>
<hr />
<p>We both mortify what I have become</p>
<hr />

<div class="whitespace">
<p>Holly did not know who And what Henry "darling"</p>
<hr />
<p>masturbation is the key</p>
<p>To release a dull life.</p>
<hr />
<p>Poor Henry... His cock was so-so soft and the thought of fucking strange and beautiful women and men torqued his intestines to the left.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kind of like a leftist that plays with a broken yo-yo he would even veer off a little bit. He knew where to find that.</p>
<p>But it wasn't like <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>       He was poor and lazy</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes he'd be gearin' up for the streets.</p>
<p>He'd be Lazy,Lazy, Lazy;</p>
<p>              SHOCKED</p>
<p>By a lazy God. And only God can trust Jesus and Jesus only. (According to Henry) And only God can make things happen...</p>
<hr />
<p>What? Jesus who?  No poor man with a beard could ever help him now.</p>
<p>But he still prayed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Henry never knew why everyone called him "darling."</p>
<hr />
<p>He certainly would lean on one fuckin' after in'n an after outin' he thought.</p>
<p>And never be as sold as fuck again.</p>
<p style="white-space:normal;">He knew Satan was a waste of time. He knew he didn't have the weakness or the strength or the magic, the courage, the passion or the interest, to learn...He knew he'd jus rather gonna get fucked up then be with the boys then be... With you, I reckon.  Her. Him. Self-help hating himself. You! As I hate fuck-hating you to hate me. Awh, Holy horseshit, I just can't figure it out. I gotta hang myself for it.</p>
<p>He-Man he knowed how'd tuh haw haw this'er whoah woe is me that.  While other folks be sayin' do "this" do "that."</p>
<p>Fer people that wanted to view heem er hear heem er evenin' touch heem.</p>
<p style="white-space:normal;">Say'n: "don't try and live.  But never say die, or: take out'er dine innards from a rotten mule from my daddy who walked off and left us no home with out no horse with.</p>
<hr />
<p>Well I'll tell you what: That ol' memory ain't never gonna die."</p>
