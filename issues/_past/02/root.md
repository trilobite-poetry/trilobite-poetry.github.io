## year zero: faciality

<div class="tradwrap">

<p><em>i. tree: life, roots and crown</em> </p>

<hr />

<p>motion may be eliminated but its introduction nevertheless
</p>

<p>drives the belief that merely </p>

<p>recognizing the program of the unforeseen </p>

<p>makes time useless again. </p>

<hr />

<p>put yourself at the interval of the interval. divide therefore
</p>

<p>your own science and isolate the same. </p>

<hr />

<p>how can actuality be produced? </p>

<hr />

<p>the operative cytoplasm, the centrosome </p>

<p>attract too the broken and original forms. </p>

<hr />

<p>two fresh constructed lines and the least </p>

<p>of these operations attract some sugar, some oil. </p>

<hr />

<p>being of matter, what is gained is reconstructed </p>

<p>even in its organic and vital activity. </p>

<hr />

<p>unite and deny to an arrangement </p>

<p>the irreversibility of your ignorance. </p>

<hr />

<p>we only grow old. our loss is certain. </p>

<hr />

<p>only the discontinuity of the living is the same. </p>

<p>only the embryo and all its programmed inevitabilities. </p>

<hr />

<p><em>ii. fish: richness, the unknown</em> </p>

<hr />

<p>excrescence. a bud endeavors </p>

<p>to continue the continuous </p>

<p>and we feel like we live. there is no </p>

<p>dazzling prospect, only necessity. </p>

<hr />

<p>the going from atoms to something to </p>

<p>nothing of calculation. </p>

<hr />

<p>touch destruction. our evolutionary phenomenon </p>

<p>will not in any way be said </p>

<p>to be progress. all these short intervals </p>

<hr />

<p>on which we fix our attention </p>

<p>embrace in this same body of the universe. </p>

<hr />

<p>we form agreed on schemas of this, the entire world </p>

<p>as the result of the mutually produced </p>

<p>authority of experience by which </p>

<p>the vital action, the continuous generation </p>

<hr />

<p>is falsely implied. </p>

## introduction: rhizome

<div class="tradwrap">

<p><em>i. flowers: present, creativity</em> </p>

<hr />

<p>a curve so small it is part </p>

<p>of a tangent, a point </p>

<p>he will consider. that is to say </p>

<hr />

<p>a number, but only that. </p>

<p>he is always reborn </p>

<p>as if it were nothing more </p>

<p>than inhalation, repetition. </p>

<hr />

<p>old elements repeat to foretell phenomena </p>

<p>the explanations of which are easier in glass. </p>

<hr />

<p>that which imparts elements </p>

<p>is that which is meant to say </p>

<p>properly speaking, there is no impartial. </p>

<hr />

<p>all is viewed from end to end. all is construed </p>

<p>as photographs, as the physiochemical endeavor </p>

<p>to reduce phenomena. we can be </p>

<hr />

<p>certain of others, like those between </p>

<p>two partitions who would create </p>

<hr />

<p>little organisms. how </p>

<p>can they actually be produced? </p>

<hr />

<p><em>ii. book: secret, unknown</em> </p>

<hr />

<p>the entire world is the result of mutual biology </p>

<p>of the mathematics of the physics of the mathematics </p>

<p>lost in the mass of some ancient geometry. </p>

<hr />

<p>reject our radical finalism. the doctrine </p>

<p>of our teleology, of this world </p>

<p>as outward appearance of excrescence. </p>

<hr />

<p>the buds endeavor to continue the continuous </p>

<p>by which vital action the continuity </p>

<p>of the generated is implied. if we were not to be </p>

<hr />

<p>of matter what would be gained? nothing </p>

<p>would be past, would be present. we could </p>

<p>imagine ourselves at no point, represented only </p>

<hr />

<p>by an immense system of simultaneity. </p>

<p>motion could be eliminated, but this introduction </p>

<p>is nevertheless in belief that if necessary </p>

<hr />

<p>we could turn back from atoms </p>

<p>to nothing.</p>
