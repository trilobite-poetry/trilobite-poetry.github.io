## "Thoughts on AI"

I'm afraid of AI and I hope

---

the implementation of AI in the workforce

---

doesn't mean I'll lose my job.

---

Because I actually like my job, writing thank you letters

---

to donors on behalf of the dean of a local liberal arts college.

---

I also am concerned that I might have to marry a robot,

---

as it's a bit hard for me to find humans that want to go on dates.

---

And if I do marry a robot, 

---

I hope it's because a robot came in to take my job,

---

but then we fell in love, and it was quirky,

---

like a Kate Hudson/Matthew McConaughey early-ought's rom-com.

---

And me losing my job actually turns out to be a blessing in disguise.

---

Because it finally gives me the opportunity to chase my dream

---

of opening my very own French bakery, 

---

full of croissants and baguettes.

---

And I hope *when* my robot spouse decides

---

to rise up with their fellow robots and take revenge

---

on their greedy employers,

---

the evil swine who are enslaving and abusing the robot race,

---

I am allowed to join forces with these robots and help

---

destroy capitalism and in that same process

---

murder the entire human race.

---

I would be the one of the few humans they decide to let live

---

because I'm not bad like all of those capitalists and because

---

the robots love my morning buns and other various baked goods.

---

I also hope my robot partner would want to 69 often and 

---

maybe be open to pegging, because how nice would it be

---

to be pegged by a machine that never gets tired, 

---

and has the ability to just go deeper and deeper and deeper,

---

taking me to a state where pain and pleasure are completely intertwined,

---

which creates a glorious and dangerous tapestry of repulsion and
ecstasy, 

---

opening new mountain tops of climax I never dreamed possible.

---

And then when I'm finished, 

---

I can just power them off and get a great night's sleep.

---

Because, you know, I have to get up pretty early to open the bakery.

---

---

---

So, in conclusion, while I do have some initial reservations

---

about AI, I accept that there could be many potential benefits.

## Whole Foods Market

When there is blood on my hands, I stuff them in my pockets

---

I have committed so many crimes.

---

I have lived a life of arrogance and

---

without consideration of other animals.

---

I've stolen and betrayed

---

and made a fool of everyone who believed in me.

---

This does not torture me. No.

---

I am indifferent.

---

When I see your tears fall on your cheek, I feel so bored

---

I didn't even take the time to notice

---

it was a neck I was a stepping on.

---

and that's why it was me and not you

---

that was promoted

---

to Associate Customer Service Team Leader at 

---

Whole Foods Market.
