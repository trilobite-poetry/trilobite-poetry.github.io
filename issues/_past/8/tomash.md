## Of Perspective

the sensation of tumbling of
{: .nj }

being flung and pushed out of
{: .nj }

control pines and rocks shift the
{: .nj }

mountain recomposes itself the
{: .nj }

sea is pieced of inexactness
{: .nj }

pulverized abalone oyster
{: .nj }

mussel the spines of fish the
{: .nj }

housings of barnacles in the
{: .nj }

foam at the end of the ocean a
{: .nj }

hazy outline white mountains
{: .nj }

white clouds which white is
{: .nj }

which sand in my mouth
{: .nj }

sticking to my lips and teeth my
{: .nj }

arms fingers spread wide long
{: .nj }

bones reaching into the
{: .nj }

sensation of tumbling the
{: .nj }

mountain flung inexplicable
{: .last }

## Of Pattern

it is a time of extreme cold sap
{: .nj }

descended to tree roots leaves
{: .nj }

all
fallen birds flown to the left
{: .nj }

and right margins oblique lines
{: .nj }

sweeping
upward it is a time
{: .nj }

caught between the soft *om* of
{: .nj }

clearing her throat
and silence
{: .nj }

it's time to make small stitches
{: .nj }

along an edge one person
can
{: .nj }

walk only when becoming air
{: .last }

## Of Direction

white roots nets strung with
{: .nj }

eyeless tubers sewing together
{: .nj }

the ball of
earth black veins
{: .nj }

exploding reached inside rock
{: .nj }

we grow offshoots double
{: .nj }

rapidly a live trunk in mist after
{: .nj }

burning trees standing in water a
{: .nj }

foot up their trunks repeated in
{: .nj }

mud pines edge toward their
{: .nj }

own
solitary completion which
{: .nj }

way where the old houses are
{: .nj }

bordered by
burned grass and
{: .nj }

every crumbling form is
{: .nj }

outlined in red blue and gold
{: .nj }

and the delicate blur of pigeon
{: .nj }

wings some skimming the
{: .nj }

surface of the
bricks some
{: .nj }

angling upwards
{: .last }
