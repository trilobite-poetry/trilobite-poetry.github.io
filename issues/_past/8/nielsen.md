Long-listed

At long last

---

No more to be sold short

As an afterword

---

No more to be sold on

An afterworld

---

If we could only resonate together

This could be the last time

---

Sunshine on my shudder

Start me up Buttercup

---

This could be the last time

May be the last time

---

I don't know

## Sky Poses

An open question

At the shore

The sky poses

---

A coy gathering of clouds

Against our steaming hopes

At risk of storm

---

Shifting from last year's

To last years

The central truth of song

---

Emerging from a rush

Of punctuated listening

And surf crash

---

Against all

Our

Expectation

## The Night We Opened for the Buckinghams and I Didn't Hear the Buckinghams

The shortest distance between

Two high school auditoriums

Was a song and a Silvertone

---

And a Pontiac

---

Sound check straining

Against their image spreading

Cream across kind

Of a Drag the singer

Nowhere to be seen

You Don't Care

---

Hey Baby They're Playing Our Song

## Of That *G* That Is In *Phlegm*

Close to the close

An effacement of those

Nights' daring

Undoing drew nigh

---

The merely near

Withdrew

Gave way

---

Gave place to the might

Of what may

Have been

---

The daughters of earth and darkness

Gave promise

Grave possession

Of the altered

---

In this way

The gravitons

Saved the inaudible

From the indelible
